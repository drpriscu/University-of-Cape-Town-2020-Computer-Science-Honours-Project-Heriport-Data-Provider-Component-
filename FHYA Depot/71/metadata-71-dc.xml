  <dc:source>[Source - Ettore Morelli for FHYA, 2020: A digitised copy of the book published by the French missionary Eugene Casalis, being the translation of the book about his life in Lesotho published in French two years before. As for the French edition, note that the book was published during the wars between Lesotho and the Republic of the Orange Free State. It appears that the translation was done by Casalis himself. The book contains lithographies and a map,  included in this digital copy.]</dc:source>

  <dc:descriptions>8039). When an eland has been wounded, |kaggen (the Mantis) is angry with the people (he 'does not love us if we kill an eland'). He does various things to trouble the man who shot the eland and thus make the eland get up and live and not die from its wounds. Also, when the people shoot gemsbok, hares appear, and if people shoot the hares then the gemsbok will recover and live.</dc:descriptions>

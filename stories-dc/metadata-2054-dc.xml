  <dc:description>Notes on |auni Vol.2, made at Frankenwald Research Station, Witwatersrand University (presumably, it doesn't say so in the notebook). Words and sentences and personal history, including some rough genealogies. Also some fragmented information relating to daily life including hunting, taking a wife, making huts, 'curing', and artefacts, as well as the 'retirement' of menstruating girls in huts. The final unnumbered pages of the notebook have been left blank.</dc:description>

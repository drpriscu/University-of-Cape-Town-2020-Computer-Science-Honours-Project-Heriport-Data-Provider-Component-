  <dc:description>An account of the methods favoured by the !kun in dealing with theft among their people. If a woman steals and her parents are alive she is given over to them and taken away to their country. The husband returns the stolen item and beats or kills his wife. Another part of the account deals with children that steal. If an orphaned female child living with others steals, her foster family gives her to the person from whom she stole. They put her in a hut where they burn and kill her. In another part of the account a man who has stolen is shot with many arrows. Men are shot and women are burned. If a child steals the child is scolded but not killed. If that child grows up and then steals, it is killed.</dc:description>

  <dc:descriptions>An account of the doings of a family of lions (apparently a continuation of one of the Ichneumonâ€™s speeches, in the myth of the Mantis) gives a good deal of conversation of such a description as might naturally be ascribed by Bushmen to lions (L II-10. 1051-1099, 11. 1100-1170).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>The verso pages give further details on how the lion steals up on the people and how they chase the lions away with heated embers.</dc:descriptions>

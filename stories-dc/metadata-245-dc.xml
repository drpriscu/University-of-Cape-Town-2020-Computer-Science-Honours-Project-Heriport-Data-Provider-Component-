  <dc:descriptions>An account of the doings of a family of lions (apparently a continuation of one of the Ichneumonâ€™s speeches, in the myth of the Mantis) gives a good deal of conversation of such a description as might naturally be ascribed by Bushmen to lions (L II.-10. 1051-1099, 11. 1100-1170).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>Also gives details of their sizes and roles in the pride, the teaching of young lions to hunt and other information about their hunting habits.</dc:descriptions>

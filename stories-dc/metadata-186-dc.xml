  <dc:descriptions>Besides a short account of the first portion of this remarkable myth (L II.-1. 278-284), we have one connected account of it (L II.-2. 305-323).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>The two Lions come upon a Tortoise. The Lion called !gu swallows the Tortoise down whole while it is still alive. The Tortoise talks from the front of the Lion's head and tells the men that they must burn the Lions because they are man-eaters. The men chase the Lions with fire. The other Lion reprimands !gu for not sharing the Tortoise and eating him whole, which has resulted in their misfortune.</dc:descriptions>

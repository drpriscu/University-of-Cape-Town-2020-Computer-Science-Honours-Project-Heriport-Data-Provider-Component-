  <dc:descriptions>Thirty pages of interviews collected by Jemima Bleek in 1879 with a three 'Hottentot' informants (I, II and III), members of a family ('Lynx') sent to the house in Mowbray in error. The vocabulary mostly concerns parts of the human body, features of the landscape and daily life, and names of animals, and there are some sentences and phrases (most of which were given by 'Piet') concerning times of the day and daily life. There are also snippets of personal history and many examples of communication in Dutch in the course of the interviews.</dc:descriptions>

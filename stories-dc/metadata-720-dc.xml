  <dc:description>The sorcerers see a handsome person and cause him to be ill. The dogs cannot sleep for barking at the sorcerers, and the sick man dies, although he has been doctored. (L VIII.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>15. 7298</dc:description>
  <dc:description>7303). When a good</dc:description>
  <dc:description>looking or 'handsome' person falls ill and dies, the !giten (sorcerers) seize that person. Every time he seems to get better they 'shoot' (bewitch) him again, making him ill, and he never recovers. Their arrows kill people even when they are being 'snored'.</dc:description>

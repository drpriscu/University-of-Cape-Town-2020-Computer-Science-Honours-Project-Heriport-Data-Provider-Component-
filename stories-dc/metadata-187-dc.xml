  <dc:description>Besides a short account of the first portion of this remarkable myth (L II.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>1. 278</dc:description>
  <dc:description>284), we have one connected account of it (L II.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>2. 305</dc:description>
  <dc:description>323). A Muishond is in its hole and runs away, but stops because its side is decaying. The Lion follows its scent and takes the decayed piece in its mouth. The decayed piece tells the Lion to instead drag the child out of the hole and the Lion agrees to catch the little Muishond. The little Muishond runs away and the decayed piece of thigh tells the thornbush to pierce the pursuing Lion's feet. The Lion screams in pain and tells the other Lion to run and catch the Muishond.  The second Lion catches the decayed piece which then cuts off its thigh and jumps away, singing.</dc:description>

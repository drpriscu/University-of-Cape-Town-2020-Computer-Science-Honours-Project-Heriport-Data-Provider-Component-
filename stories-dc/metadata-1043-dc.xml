  <dc:descriptions>The !kun (particularly women) call the young moon `!ka !karrisheâ€™ and blow on the horn of a male |ou (a small buck, probably a steenbok). The young moon points out food to the people (for example bees). This story includes Karu's prayer to the moon, in which he asks it for food ('Tell me of things, that I may eat!'). At sunrise the man (possibly Karu) goes out and kills a lizard that the moon has shown him. The wife cooks the lizard and fetches a dish to cut it up in. The man gives his wife the lizard's head to eat and she cries loudly. The man beats his wife and threatens to kill her. The wife does not speak to him because she is afraid.</dc:descriptions>

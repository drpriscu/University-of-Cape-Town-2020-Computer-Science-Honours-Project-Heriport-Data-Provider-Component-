  <dc:descriptions>|xue is at the top of a large palm tree and asks his wife to cut off his ears (it seems that the wind is loud and frightens him). She refuses and says that he is not her husband, because her husband is a man. She runs away from him. |xue goes searching for the woman (his wife). He cries and calls for her as he goes, and when his wife hears this she returns to him. |xue threatens to kill his wife if she runs away again so she runs off crying out in fear for her life. |xue chases after his wife and later makes an earthen house and lies there to sleep. The rain falls on |xue and then stops, and the Moon rises. |xue awakes and leaves the hut to sleep on the bare earth. [It says 'to be continued' on page 9626, but appears not to have been.]</dc:descriptions>

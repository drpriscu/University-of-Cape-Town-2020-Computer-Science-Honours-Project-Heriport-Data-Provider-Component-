  <dc:descriptions>... a story describing how the Mantis is tricked by the Great Tortoise (L II.-5.  565-624, 8. 811-882).  This is followed by a discourse upon the degrees of understanding possessed by various animals (L II.-8.  822-892).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>|kaggen (the Mantis) strokes the neck of the Great Tortoise and she pulls her head  into her neck hole, so his arms get stuck and decay. |kaggen tells a lizard (the !khauw) to rub the Great Tortoise's neck and the Great Tortoise pulls her head in again (story continues largely untranslated). |kaggen flies into the water (as a vulture) where the water washes off his 'arms' feathers' and he becomes a man again and returns home (see 859v) where he is counselled by the Ichneumon. Thereafter is an account of how he dreams and gets 'understanding's thoughts' and becomes an 'understanding's person'.</dc:descriptions>

  <dc:descriptions>A fragmented and partly translated story about hunting, quaggas and the slicing of flesh. Two lions jump upon the original hunters and carry off the flesh. There is a significant break in translation and then "Korhaan Malkop" is talking about carrying a child to fetch water. Eventually two women leave the child with a man and fetch water by themselves, and are berated for doing so. A woman goes back and is killed and eaten. The korhaan and the lions feature again.</dc:descriptions>

  <dc:description>Naron notebook, Vol. IX? (with Auen contributions too). Fairly fragmented accounts of contemporary life, history and building of the settlement, and personal history; much daily life, including illness, names of plants and animals, rain and seasons and food, fire, habits of animals, and burial practises and family life. Some interesting descriptions of using buchu to say 'goodbye' to the dead. Mostly in the form of words and sentences with some scattered narrative.</dc:description>

  <dc:descriptions>A note has been made, from //k bbo s information, of a story not yet written down in Bushman, telling how the Rain carried off a girl belonging to the First Bushmen (or the ancient people living before the Bushmen), who afterwards became a frog, her kaross being changed into a springbok, etc. Her people were also transformed (L II.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>37. 3335 rev. and 3336 rev.). Versions of this transformation into frogs, ascribed chiefly to a New Maiden s acts of disobedience, are given in the Katkop dialect by !kw iten ta ||k n (L VI.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>1. 3930</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3958), and by Dia!kw in (B XXVII. 2609</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>2618, continued in L V.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>2. 3864</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3881). Three maidens get caught in the rain. Two of the older girls glide across the Rain's back safely, but the third girl is a new maiden and falls into the spring and becomes a frog. The water</dc:descriptions>

  <dc:descriptions>The Lioness and her adopted daughter, Tssi–!kuára–Ihin. By /han≠kass’o (L VIII.-25. 8084-8169, 8171 and 8172, 25. 8173-8176).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>The Lioness (in the times of the Early Race) decides to keep a baby girl that she finds and names it Biting-Torn-Away (or Tssi-!kuarra |hin), and she grows up. The Lioness tricks a child into sending her brother to her at night, but his grandmothers, !kwa-!kwa and !kwa-kau, are also there (they are people and also trees). The Lioness tries to find a way of catching the young man on his own, but Biting-Torn-Away protects him and warns him how to behave around her mother. Whenever the Lioness tells a lie when she is near the fire, !kwa-!kau and !kwa-!kwa crackle from within it, causing her to move away. The Lioness kills a gemsbok and Biting-Torn-Away and the young man go to help her. The Lioness places some of the meat into a thong that she twists around her body, and asks Biting-Torn-Away to help lift her up. While Biting-Torn-Away lifts her mother's arms, the husband stabs her exposed flesh with his knife. The young man returns to his own mother's house, bringing Biting-Torn-Away with him.</dc:descriptions>

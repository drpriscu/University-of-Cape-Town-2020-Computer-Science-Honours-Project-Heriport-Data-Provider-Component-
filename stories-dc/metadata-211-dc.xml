  <dc:descriptions>Then follows a description of an attack which the |kaggen makes upon a Cat, which was quietly going along, singing a certain song about the Lynx, who had said that the Cat could not run as well as she did.  As the Cat manages to render it impossible for the Mantis to harm her, he has again to consult his grandson, the Ichneumon, in order to gain the victory (L II.-5. 547-565).  A second version of the same story is a direct continuation of one version of !góë-!kweitentu  (L II.-9.  966-978).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>The Cat walks along singing of the Lynx who has derided her for not being able to run. |kaggen (the Mantis) and the Cat fight but the Cat puts its head in the ground and |kaggen beats its tail instead. He flies away and grows feathers calling for his Hartebeest children to follow. He flies into the water and out again and summons his things and returns home. The Ichneumon asks who has fought |kaggen and tells him how to fight the Cat. |kaggen fights the Cat again and beats it on the head and returns home. |kaggen says that he is the equal of the Cat but the Ichneumon calls him foolish and says that it was he, the Ichneumon (a child) who has taught |kaggen to fight the Cat.</dc:descriptions>

  <dc:descriptions>The Stars are divided into night stars and dawn stars ... The 'Dawn’s Heart' (the star Jupiter) has a daughter, who is identified with some neighbouring star preceding Jupiter (at the time when we asked, it was Regulus or Alpha Leonis). Her name is the 'Dawn’s–Heart–child', and her relation to her father is somewhat mysterious. Besides a short statement of the nature of the Dawn’s</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>Heart, and of his child (L II.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>2. 292 and 293), we have two long pieces. The first of these begins with a short narrative of only eleven columns, and then gives a very long discourse from the Dawn’s–Heart to his daughter, which treats not only of their own history and that of the lynx–mother, but also of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and of the habits of different animals. The Day's Heart star buries his child alive and goes away. Other creatures come by including the child's mother. The father gives the daughter directions in a speech in which he tells her her name and the doings of various animals and stars, such as ||ko hai. He also tells her about the behaviour of people and what they must do in their daily lives with food and so on, and about the heavens and their creation.</dc:descriptions>

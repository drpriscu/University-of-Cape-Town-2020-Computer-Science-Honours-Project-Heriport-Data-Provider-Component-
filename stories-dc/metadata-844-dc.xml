  <dc:description>8268). A youth of the Early Race is seen by a commando of Korannas, so he acts as if he were a little child ('swaying about'). There is some debate among the Korannas as to whether to kill the child or not, but eventually they help him load up his water bottles and send him on his way. He returns home and tells his people what he has seen, and they leave for the mountains. The Korannas come, believing the people to still be there.</dc:description>

  <dc:descriptions>...From some of these materials, and from other sources, twelve genealogical diagrams (in oblong double folio) have been compiled, each giving all the known ancestors of one individual, frequently extending four, and sometimes five generations back. The names and genealogies of various |xam, the groups they belong to, the places they come from and some details of their personal history. Page 908v features the names of |xam 'who went with Mr Anthing to Cape [illegible] in 1863 (?)'. Details about the men are given and the names, given in |xam and Dutch, include 'Haard Klaas' and 'Isaac Bastard'. A good many genealogical notes and portions of Bushman family history have been taken down. (B II. 349, 359 rev., 360</dc:descriptions>

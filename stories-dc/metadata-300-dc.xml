  <dc:descriptions>The Sun, a man from whose armpit brightness proceeded, lived formerly on earth; but only gave light for a space around his house. Some children belonging to the First Bushmen (who preceded the Flat Bushmen in their country) were therefore sent to throw up the sleeping Sun into the sky; since then, he shines all over the earth. We have two complete versions of this myth, a short one (L II.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4. 487 and 488, 488a</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>k, 494</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>499), and a longer one (LII.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>35. 3150</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3159, 3165</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3236 rev.).  Besides these, we have the beginning of a version in the dialect of Stuurman’s Fontein, the Karreebergen (B XXIV. 2262 and 2263); and a fragment in the same dialect (L II.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>35. 3164).  Regarding a similar myth met with among some of the Australian Aborigines, vide Cape Monthly Magazine, February 1874, pp.98–102. A fragment of a version of the creation of the Sun story in which an old woman speaks to her children telling them to go and throw up the sleeping Sun into the sky to make lightness.</dc:descriptions>

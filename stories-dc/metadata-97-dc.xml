  <dc:descriptions>[Not translated] The Sun, a man from whose armpit brightness proceeded, lived formerly on earth; but only gave light for a space around his house. Some children belonging to the First Bushmen (who preceded the Flat Bushmen in their country) were therefore sent to throw up the sleeping Sun into the sky; since then, he shines all over the earth...Besides these [two complete versions], we have the beginning of a version in the dialect of Stuurman s Fontein, the Karreebergen (B XXIV. 2262 and 2263).</dc:descriptions>

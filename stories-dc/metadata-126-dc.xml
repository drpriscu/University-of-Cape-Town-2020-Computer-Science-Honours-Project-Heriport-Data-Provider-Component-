  <dc:description>[of 'new maidens'] into frogs, ascribed chiefly to a new Maiden s acts of disobedience, are given in the Katkop dialect by !kw iten ta //k n (L VI. 1. 3930 3958), and by Dia!kw in. (B XXVII. 2609 2618, continued in L V. 2. 3864 3881). When a girl becomes a new maiden she must not look at people or else she will transfix them. This is what happened to the young man long ago when the new maiden looked at him after she had gone to hear him play his !goura. That is why the new maidens have to lie in a house made for them by the old women so they cannot look or laugh at anyone. The old women take care of them. A maiden disobeys her mother and leaves the house to go wash herself in the spring. As a result she and her people are taken away by the Rain and transformed into frogs.

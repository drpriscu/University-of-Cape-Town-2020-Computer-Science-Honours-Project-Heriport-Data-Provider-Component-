  <dc:descriptions>The Black Crow calls the Jackal and the Jackal comes. Day's Heart's child mocks the Jackal and they both get angry. The Jackal calls the Blue Crane and they look for the child. The Jackal wants to make the child her daughter. The Blue Crane goes along singing with the Krieboom on her shoulder. She arrives where Day's Heart's child sits and agrees with the Jackal that the child is 'not a little white'.</dc:descriptions>

  <dc:descriptions>A full-grown Bushman, whom the narrator knew, punished by a lion for having eaten forbidden portions of the lion’s prey, as a child. Told by Día!kwãin (L V.-8. 4574-4617 1/2,  9. 4618, with notes upon 4616 rev. and 4617 rev.).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>|xam parents tell their children about what happened to Xwerri-kau, as a lesson about the eating of certain things: Xwerri-kau (who had eaten prohibited parts of game as a child) was pursuing a quagga when a lion sprang on him, and the quagga lay down to die once it saw that the lion had bitten him. This story illustrates how lions remember what children do and take revenge in various ways on the hunting ground when they are grown-ups. It also contains information about the hunting-ground.</dc:descriptions>

  <dc:description>The veritable Hottentot myth of the 'Origin of Death' is told in the Katkop dialect by  k sin, whose father was a Hottentot; and, although the narrator says that he heard the story from his mother / w   k , a Bushwoman, its Hottentot origin can hardly be doubted. Here, the Moon sends the Hare to men with the message of the renewal of life; but it reverses it into a message of death. The angered Moon then heats a stone, and burns the Hare s mouth, causing the harelip.  k sin told this story three times; once in a very short version (B XXV. 2361</dc:description>
  <dc:description>2364), secondly, in a little longer one (L IV.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>4. 3886</dc:description>
  <dc:description>3889) and thirdly, in a still more extended one (L IV.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>4. 3890</dc:description>
  <dc:description>3900). On account of the Hare's actions, people die and do not return to life.</dc:description>

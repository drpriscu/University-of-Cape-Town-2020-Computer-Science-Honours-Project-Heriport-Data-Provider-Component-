  <dc:descriptions>The veritable Hottentot myth of the 'Origin of Death' is told in the Katkop dialect by ≠kásin, whose father was a Hottentot; and, although the narrator says that he heard the story from his mother /’wá ≠kõ, a Bushwoman, its Hottentot origin can hardly be doubted. Here, the Moon sends the Hare to men with the message of the renewal of life; but it reverses it into a message of death. The angered Moon then heats a stone, and burns the Hare’s mouth, causing the harelip. ≠kásin told this story three times; once in a very short version (B XXV. 2361</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>2364), secondly, in a little longer one (L IV.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4. 3886</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3889) and thirdly, in a still more extended one (L IV.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4. 3890</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3900). On account of the Hare's actions, people die and do not return to life.</dc:descriptions>

  <dc:descriptions>The Bushman Doctor or Sorcerer (L II</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>1. 273</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>275). An account of these people was also given in the Katkop dialect by Dia!kw in (L V.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3. 4122</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4131), from whom we besides have two reports of cures performed upon himself. The first of these (L V.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3. 4132</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4161, 4. 4162</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4199) includes a speech made by the sorceress; the second relates how she cured him when injured by a Kafir (L V.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4. 4200</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>4230). A black man attempts to take Dia!kwain's mother's iron spoons (left to her by her dead husband) and has harmed her family in other ways (the same man poisoned Dia!kwain's aunt). Dia!kwain fights him and afterwards his throat is sore and swollen from the fight. His worried mother asks an old healer (!kwarra</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>an) to 'snore' him.</dc:descriptions>

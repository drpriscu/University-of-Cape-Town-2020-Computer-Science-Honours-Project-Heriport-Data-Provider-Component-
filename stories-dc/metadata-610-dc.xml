  <dc:descriptions>The Mantis and |kwámmana go out visiting together.  The Mantis involves himself in a quarrel with a young “Dasse” (Hyrax), and stones fall upon him and |kwámmana.  The latter, upon whom they lie loosely, is first rescued; while the Mantis owes his rescue to the entreaties of his wife, who prevails upon the people to take him out.–His teasing and troublesome ways are much blamed. (L VIII.–2. 6165–6193, and 6195.)  Another version of the story of the Crow Messengers appears, here, in connexion with the adventure related above;  |kwámmana and his companion being, in this instance, those who were found by the successful bird (Corvus scapulatus). (L VIII.–2.  6147–6157) By the same narrator was also given the Rescue of |kwámmana  and the Mantis, and their return home.  The Blue Crane, who is the elder sister of |kaggen, pities his sad condition.–Specimens of the peculiar manner in which the Bushman language is spoken by the wife of |kaggen, and by the Ichneumon, respectively, are here given.  (L VIII.–2. 6196–6231, 3. 6232–6236.) A note regarding the ≠kam–!kwê, a member of the party which went to the rescue of /kwámmana and his companion (L VII.-2. 6195 rev. and 6196 rev.).</dc:descriptions>

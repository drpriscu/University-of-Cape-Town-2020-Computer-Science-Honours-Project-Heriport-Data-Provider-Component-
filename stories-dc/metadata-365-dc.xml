  <dc:description>The veritable Hottentot myth of the  Origin of Death  is told in the Katkop dialect by #k sin, whose father was a Hottentot; and, although the narrator says that he heard the story from his mother, a Bushwoman, its Hottentot origin can hardly be doubted.  Here, the Moon sends the Hare to men with the message of the renewal of life; but it reverses it into a message of death. The angered Moon then heats a stone, and burns the Hare s mouth, causing the harelip.    k sin told this story three times;  once in a very short version (B XXV. 2361 2364), secondly, in a little longer one (L IV.4. 3882</dc:description>
  <dc:description>3885), and thirdly, in a still more extended one (L IV.  4. 3890 3900). The Moon sends the Hare to tell the people who are ill that they will live again like he does. The Hare changes the Moon's words and tells the people that they will stay dead and vanish from the earth when they die. The angry Moon punishes the Hare by burning his mouth.</dc:description>

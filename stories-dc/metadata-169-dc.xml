  <dc:descriptions>The hyena ('wolf') sleeps covered in earth. It leaps from the ground and runs away when people come, because it fears them. They chase and shoot it and burn off its hair. They then carry its body to their house, where they cut it up, cook it and eat plentifully of its flesh. They then sleep, satisfied.</dc:descriptions>

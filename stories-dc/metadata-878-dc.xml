  <dc:descriptions>The winds which are supposed to appertain to different persons. (L VIII.-28. 8459-8465).</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>After the wind has blown and dies, the place becomes warm from the sunshine (its 'eye' is warm). The wind becomes cold when a man kills an animal (the killed thing's wind) and the people say that his wind is cold. When it is hot the wind is gentle and not strong like the other.</dc:descriptions>

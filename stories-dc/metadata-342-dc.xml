  <dc:descriptions>A fable, somewhat similar to the Hottentot one of the lion and the jackal who went to shoot elands ('Reynard the Fox in South Africa', p.3, etc.), was told in the Katkop dialect, by #k sin (L IV.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>1. 3486</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3515); from whose dictation another beginning of the same fable has also been written down (L IV.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>1. 3485). A slightly different version, likewise given by  k sin, has only been hurriedly taken down in English (L IV.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>1. 3484 rev.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>3492 rev.). A Jackal shoots an eland and the Lion comes and takes it away. The Jackal is advised by a sorceress to remain at home and she will make everything vanish. The next day, after the eland has been shot, the sorceress makes a mountain where its body lies and the Lion cannot find it. The Lion asks for water and for fat, but the Jackal kills him by placing a heated stone in the Lion's mouth instead of fat.</dc:descriptions>

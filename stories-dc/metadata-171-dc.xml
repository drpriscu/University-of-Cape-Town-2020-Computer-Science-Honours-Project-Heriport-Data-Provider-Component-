  <dc:description>Not only in the astrological mythology, but also in the world of Bushman Fable, the lion naturally occupies a prominent position. One fine fable relates how the hyena revenged itself upon the lion, who had grudged it food, by inviting him to its own house, and then, while feeding him with soup, inverting the heated pot upon his head, and beating him to death underneath it. Of this fable we have two versions, the second being probably the better of the two (L II.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>2. 361</dc:description>
  <dc:description>368); whilst the earlier (LII.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>1.257, 256 rev.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>260 rev.) closes with the usual refrain respecting suitable marriages in animal life.</dc:description>

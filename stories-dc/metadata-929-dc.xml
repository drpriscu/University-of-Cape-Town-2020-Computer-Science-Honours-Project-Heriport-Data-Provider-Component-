  <dc:descriptions>8842). A tale of the Early Race in which a lazy young woman's breast gets stuck in the cleft of a rock. The two Lions (!haue ta ≠hou and !gu) approach her (intending to kill her), but she convinces them to go and drink water before eating her. She commands the water to 'Go away yonder!' and the Lions follow it in vain. She cuts off her nipple, releasing her breast from the rock, and pounds it together with !kai from the Lions' bag to make two balls which she leaves at the rock. When the Lions return they wonder where the girl has gone. Her nipple ball answers 'I am her!'. The two Lions spend the night trying to catch the girl and hurting their teeth biting at the rocks.</dc:descriptions>

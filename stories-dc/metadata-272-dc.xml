  <dc:descriptions>The account of the Mantis when he takes away the eggs of a certain fabulous bird, named !k ken!k ka k u , is very curious.  This bird has the power of making one of its eggs (and also the brush</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>spoon with which the egg is eaten) adhere, in the most comical manner, to the mouth of the Mantis, as well as the whole load of eggs to his back, whence they cannot be removed until all the eggs are humbly carried back by the robber to the magic bird s nest.  Of this story we have two versions, a shorter one (L II.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>6. 677</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>715, 7. 716</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>737), the end of which (where the Mantis brings home real ostrich eggs) is prolonged into an account of 'Ostriches and Bushmen', and a longer one, which //k bbo had from his mother, !kw </dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>a ; and which includes another discourse from the Ichneumon (L II.</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>22. 1965</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>2042, 23. 2043</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>2134, 24. 2135</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>2212). The Ichneumon continues his discourse to |kaggen (the Mantis) after he has taken !kaken</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>!kaka</dc:descriptions>
  <dc:descriptions>!k'aui's eggs. In it he tells of the doings of animals and of plants in different seasons; about bees, honey and flowers; about the preparation of food; also a lengthy account of the hunting of springbok and ostriches.</dc:descriptions>

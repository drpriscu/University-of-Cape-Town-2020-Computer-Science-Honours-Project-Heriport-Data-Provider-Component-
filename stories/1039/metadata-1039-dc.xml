  <dc:description>|xue bites his father, breaking his father's finger. |xue's father goes away. |xue  becomes a shana (the fruit of a small tree). The rain falls on him, and he lies down and cries when the rain is over. His father hears him and throws him over his shoulder. |xue cries very loudly so his father puts him down and he follows his father. |xue grabs a little |ou (a little buck, probably a steenbok) from some birds (!kuara). |xue's father roasts some of the meat and leaves for his own country. |xue sits at the fire and cries for his father to carry him. |xue hears his father's laughing and gets up, crying. He becomes rain and tells the rain to pour down on his father. |xue's father beats |xue and tells his wife to give |xue to another person so they can kill him. |xue hears this and cries and his father leaves. |xue follows his father and at sunrise he becomes !naxane. |xue's father puts two of the !naxane into his bag. |xue changes back to |xue and |xue's father searches for the !naxane. |xue climbs a !gua tree and refuses to come down, being afraid of being beaten. |xue's mother slaps him so that he falls from the tree. |xue becomes a lizard (gora) and then a bird (called ||kanna-tatta).

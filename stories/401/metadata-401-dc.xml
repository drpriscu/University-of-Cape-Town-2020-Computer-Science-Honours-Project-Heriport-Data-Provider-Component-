  <dc:description>The 'Jackals Tower' still visible as a 'spitzkop' on the other side of the Zak River gives rise to a 'Jackal and Hyena' fable, told to Dia!kwain by his mother =kamme-an (L V.-4. 4231-4252 1/2). A Jackal comes upon a Hyena which has killed a quagga while he is out hunting. The Hyena goes to fetch his wife while the Jackal builds a high shelter for the Hyena's children. The Hyena is pulled up by a riem and the Jackal severs it just when the Hyena is in reach of the meat, and he falls into the fire where he is burnt (accounting for the markings on his back). The Jackal protests that he is always blamed for the doings of his brother, who is really the cunning one . 1) p.4230v: Dia!kwain's mother (=kamme-an) told him this story; the |xam and Dutch names for the spitzkop (which is the setting for this story); a partly legible note about another Jackal who was formerly married to a Quagga, 2) p.4231v: the name of the Hyena's wife, 3) p.4235v: about the mouse whose entrails are made into a riem (the !ne-sarra or Klaas-nuis), 4) p.4238v: the riem is called !hau in Dia!kwain's dialect, 5) This story is found in Books V-4 and V-5.</dc:description>

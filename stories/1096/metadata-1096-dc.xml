  <dc:description>The |u' ||ke'. or Tshaka, is a small plant and is used as part of the purification ritual, or |koa. It intoxicates and can kill people if handled incorrectly (at the wrong time of day), and is thus feared. The ≠nabbi does not kill people and is given when the people 'seek their hearts'. Both plants seem to be effective at specific times of day. 1) p.9921v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu), 2) p.9923v: the ≠nabbi is given to people to eat 'when we seek our heart', 3) See also |u' ||ke' in food, 4) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-11.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>How an old woman asked a Chameleon for rain, and knew, from its way of looking, that rain would fall; as it indeed did that very night. In the Katkop dialect, by =kasin, who heard it from his mother (L IV.-3. 3701-3737).
The family smells the rain coming and find rain-plants which the old woman throws on the ground to make moisture and the two children find and cook a great tortoise and eat it. 1) Date on p.3732: 19 January 1874, 2) p.3706v: gambro is a watery root belonging to a climbing plant; !nabba is a short thorn bush without real thorns and with white flowers, called Drie Doorn in Dutch, 3) p.3707v: the old woman throws the gambro root down to wet the earth so that the rain will do the same (an unusual thing to do with this root), 4) p.3709v: the fore-kaross in the story is made from a jackal's neck-skin, 6) p.3735v: a note on the veldkos (or veldkost) or !kauwi in the story: an onion-shaped root with red outer skin eaten by the |xam (but not the leafy part), 7) p.3736v: see Food that =kasin says he does not eat and Why the chameleon must not be killed, 8) Pages 3738-3792 in this notebook are blank, 9) This story is found in Book IV-3.</dc:description>

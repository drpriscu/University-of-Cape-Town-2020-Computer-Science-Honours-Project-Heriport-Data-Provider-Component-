  <dc:description>|xue is afraid of a large bam-bam bird and becomes (or makes) a leopard (!khumm). Woodpigeons, an owl, a korubo and some ||kuorres (small mouse-like animals with cat-like eyes and tail) all laugh at the leopard. The leopard stalks a number of animals and searches for the carcass of a bam-bam bird. At sunset the leopard becomes |xue again and lies down to eat shana. He walks to the water, which is far off. He drinks all the water and shoots a young |ou (a small buck, probably a steenbok), breaking its foreleg. When |xue tries to shoot again his bow breaks. |xue goes to sleep on the bare ground and then makes a new bow from a stick.</dc:description>

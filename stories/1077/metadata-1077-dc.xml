  <dc:description>The |nu'she (a small black bird) calls when the sun is small and has not risen (it is in the ground). When the wind blows hard the rain comes, and the wind ceases when the rain falls. While the people eat the !naxane, the tt' e (a fowl-like bird) calls. These birds also eat !naxane. 1) p.9817v: (15 March 1881) !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu); the cloud-wind makes the people afraid and scorpions come and bite them in the night, 2) p.9819v: some !kun names for sweet foods found in their country, 3) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-10.</dc:description>

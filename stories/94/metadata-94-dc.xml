  <dc:description>The Ichneumon's speech in which he says that the Meerkats (suricates) cry on account of the loss of their things, which |kaggen (the Mantis) has taken to his house and hung upon the Krieboom tree that grows outside (after dreaming it so). They are likely to die of the cold and are angry because their karosses still hang on the tree. The Ichneumons speech, when the Mantis had deprived the Suricats of their possessions, is in the curious language in which the Ichneumon is supposed to speak, and in which all the clicks are converted into sounds like ts, tsy, ty, dy, etc., and other modifications also take place. (B XXIV. 2251-2255).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A good many genealogical notes and portions of Bushman family history have been taken down (B II. 349, 359 rev., 360-362, 364, 365 368-373, 376; BXXV. 2352, 2412 and 2416; L III.-1. 476-506; L IV.-1. 3452 and 3453; L VI.-1. 3895 and 3896.) From some of these materials, and from other sources, twelve genealogical diagrams (in oblong double folio) have been compiled, each giving all the known ancestors of one individual, frequently extending four, and sometimes five generations back. ||kabbo (and possibly also |han≠kass'o and |a!kunta) give names (|xam and other) and biographical details of their relations and some other people from their country. There are poignant notes relating how some of them died and their experiences with white people. 1) Date on p.478: 6 June; p.506: 19 December, 2) p.478v: a vein (given as a name to one of ||kabbo's brothers by his grandmother, who could not see and 'walked gently, feeling before her'), 3) p.483v: one of the contributors (it is not clear who) says that he knows 'Flat Bushmen', but not 'Groot River's Bushmen' as he is a 'Flat Bushman', 4) There are references to 'Stoffel',  for example on p.493, and the names of members of his family are noted; 5) It is clear ||kabbo was one of the contributors: notes on pages 480, 498, 503, and 506 refer to 'J.T'; 6) Pages 507-570 in this notebook are blank, 7) This is found in Book III-1.</dc:description>

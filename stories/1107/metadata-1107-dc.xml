  <dc:description>The Moon instructs the Sun to go to a certain place. The Moon says that he is the Moon and that he and the Sun do not listen to the Hare. The Hare is torn between laughter at the Moon's beauty and tears for those who die outright. The Hare and his wife quarrel and the Moon becomes heartsore and vanishes, making the night very dark. The She-Hare calls her husband who steals up to her in the form of a jackal and catches her. The Moon seizes the Hare and rips off his jackal-skin, which he gives to the jackal. The Hare insists that he is a jackal. [It says 'to be continued' at the bottom of page 10117 but it is not clear where this occurs.]</dc:description>

  <dc:description>An account of rain-making by means of dragging a water-animal over the land, in illustration of a Bushman painting copied by Mr J.M. Orpen (Cape Monthly Magazine for July, 1874, frontispiece), was given, in the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain, who had it from his mother (BXXVII. 2540-2608, the two first pages only translated). The beginning of this was repeated by him (L V.-3. 4075-4085), and two other accounts of rain-making were also given by him (L V.-3. 4086-4121). A story of how the rainmakers (!giten) lie in wait for a waterbull at the spring. An old rainmaker attempts to lead a waterbull (by means of a noose or thong round its neck), but fails when the thong breaks. His abilities are called into question by the people back home. 1) p.4089v: this story was told to Dia!kwain by his father (Xaa-ttin or Jacob), 2) p.4099: a different version of this part of the story given when Lloyd had trouble understanding the first taking of the tale, 3) 4110v: the waterbull is a 'strong thing', not a 'light thing', 4) p.4116v: the rainmaker of the story is also called a !gixa, 5) p.4119v: the work might have been successful if the thong and the helpers had first been sprinkled with finely powdered buchu, 6) p.4120v: buchu calms the waterbull; on the 'going away' of the rainmaker while other people sleep, 7) See also What happened when the thong (with which they were pulling at the Water's Bull) broke, or Kko-kkoro's story and Rainmaking (a version by Dia!kwain), 8) This story is found in Book V-3.</dc:description>

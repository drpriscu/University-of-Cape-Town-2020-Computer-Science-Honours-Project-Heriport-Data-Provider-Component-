  <dc:description>The !kain (formerly a man of the early race, and now a little bird which is said to resemble the Lanius collaris), the Ostrich, and the Lizard. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-30. 8668-8670). The !kain snatches the Ostrich's (the toi) head-hair, because he is vain and covets it (the Ostriches are also people of the Early Race). The !khau snatches the hair and pulls it over his own head.</dc:description>

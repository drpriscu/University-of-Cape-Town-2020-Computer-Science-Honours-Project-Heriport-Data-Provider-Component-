<title>How the Ichneumon discovered what the Mantis did with the honey (a second &apos;right&apos; version)</title>
<summary>A second &apos;right&apos; version (or elaboration) of <i>How the Ichneumon discovered what the Mantis did with the honey,</i>which Dia!kwain tells to Lloyd when going over the first version in February 1874. It appears he experienced difficulty with his first dictation. In this version the Ichneumon is advised by his brothers, after the first time he goes with |kaggen (the Mantis), to keep a splinter or a small stone knife in his mouth so that when |kaggen puts him in the sack he will be able to cut a hole to spy out of it and see from. The Ichneumon does this and then shows his brothers where to find the eland and they kill it.</summary><comments>1) See also <i>How the Ichneumon discovered what the Mantis did with the honey</i> and <i>The Ichneumon&apos;s speech when the Mantis had taken away the Meerkats&apos; possessions</i> and <i>The |kaggen wh</i>o took |kammanga&apos;s shoe, and turned it into an eland, 2) This story is found in Book V-1</comments><date>6 January 1874</date><storypages>3612v </storypages><category>|kaggen (the Mantis)</category><author>Dia!kwain (David Hoesar) (V)</author><keyword><kw>|kaggen</kw><subkw>the Mantis</subkw></keyword>

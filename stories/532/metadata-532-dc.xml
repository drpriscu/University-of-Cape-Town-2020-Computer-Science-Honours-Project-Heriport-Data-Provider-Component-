  <dc:description>Apparition seen by the party returning from the burial of the narrators wife; followed by the account of an apparition seen, on another occasion, by the narrators brother-in-law. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (L V.-22. 5810, 23. 5811-5832). Dia!kwain and his people were returning from burying his wife when they saw an apparition that resembled Dia!kwain's wife. He believed it to be something that appears at the time when sorcerers take people away. Dia!kwain's brother-in-law, Mansse, also saw an apparition on the hunting-ground. Apparitions resemble people in some ways, but are also different.</dc:description>

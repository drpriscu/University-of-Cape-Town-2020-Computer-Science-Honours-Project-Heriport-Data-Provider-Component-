  <dc:description>The Bushmen are said to have learnt the =gebbi-ggu from the Baboons, by whom it is still believed to be played. It was formerly, it is said, played also by the Ostrich and the Lion; but they fought and lost the power of playing it, becoming merely wild animals. (On page 12 of Dr. Bleeks 'Second Report concerning Bushman Researches' (Cape Town, 1875), mention is made of a fable entitled, 'The Lion jealous of the voice of the Ostrich'.) In this piece, the above-mentioned quarrel between Lion and the Ostrich and the game of =gebbi-ggu is related. The Baboon, on the contrary, still understands like a man, and speaks, sounding like one. In the Katkop dialect, by  Dia!kwain (L V.-23. 5884-5890.) The =gebbi-ggu, as performed among the Grass Bushmen, was described by /han=kasso (L VIII.-22. 7978 and 7979). The Baboon taught the =gebbi-ggu in the earlier times when Lions and Ostriches sang the =gebbi-ggu along with the Baboon. Only the baboon still speaks and understands and sings the =gebbi-ggu, sounding like a man.</dc:description>

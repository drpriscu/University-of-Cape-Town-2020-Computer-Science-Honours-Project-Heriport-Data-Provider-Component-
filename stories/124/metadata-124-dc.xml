  <dc:description>[The account of The Lions, the Tortoise, the little Hare and the old Woman], embracing the tortoise, the little hare, and the old woman, in the Katkop dialect (by Dia!kwain, who had it from his mother #kamme-an), written by L (B XXVI. 2487-2529, XXVII. 2530-2535).  It ends with the mothers advice to Dia!kwain, as a moral to the fable (B XXVII. 2535_2539).  Dia!kwain's mother tells him to pick up and take home a male tortoise if he sees one. The people worry that if they eat a tortoise it will avenge itself upon them, as it did with the lion who starved to death on account of his bad luck with finding food. But Dia!kwain's mother says that the tortoise will not take revenge if it understands that the person eating it is hungry and so a hunter must take it even if the tortoise doesn't want him to. 1)This story was told to Dia!kwain (David Hoesar) by his mother (=kamme-an), 2) Notes made on 22 February 1875 (p.2538v) including the |xam name for the ratel, or honey-badger (Ratellus mellivorus), 3) See also The Lions, the Tortoise, the little Hare and the old Woman, 4) This story is found in Book XXVII.</dc:description>

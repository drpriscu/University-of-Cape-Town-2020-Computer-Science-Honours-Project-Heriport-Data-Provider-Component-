<title>The advice that Dia!kwain&apos;s mother gave him about the tortoise, i.e. that he must not leave one, if he saw it, but must take it home</title>
<summary>[The account of The Lions, the Tortoise, the little Hare and the old Woman], <i>embracing the tortoise, the little hare, and the old woman, in the Katkop dialect (by Dia!kwãin, who had it from his mother #kámme–an), written by L (B XXVI. 2487–2529, XXVII. 2530–2535).  It ends with the mother’s advice to Dia!kwãin, as a moral to the fable (B XXVII. 2535_2539).</i>  Dia!kwain&apos;s mother tells him to pick up and take home a male tortoise if he sees one. The people worry that if they eat a tortoise it will avenge itself upon them, as it did with the lion who starved to death on account of his bad luck with finding food. But Dia!kwain&apos;s mother says that the tortoise will not take revenge if it understands that the person eating it is hungry and so a hunter must take it even if the tortoise doesn&apos;t want him to.</summary><comments>1)This story was told to Dia!kwain (David Hoesar) by his mother (≠kamme-an), 2) Notes made on 22 February 1875 (p.2538v) including the |xam name for the ratel, or honey-badger (<i>Ratellus mellivorus</i>), 3) See also <i>The Lions, the Tortoise, the little Hare and the old Woman</i>, 4) This story is found in Book XXVII</comments><date>1874</date><storypages>2535-2539</storypages><category>Custom and daily life</category><author>Dia!kwain (David Hoesar) (V)</author><keyword><kw>tortoise</kw><subkw>the advice that Dia!kwain&apos;s mother gave him about the tortoise</subkw></keyword>

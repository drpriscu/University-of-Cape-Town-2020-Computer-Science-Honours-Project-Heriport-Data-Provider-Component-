  <dc:description>... the daughter of the springbok, here named !khauko, is stolen away by the lynx, who married her. The Anteater, who is told of this by the partridge, follows them underneath the ground; whereupon the lynx unlooses his bowstring and throws it down.  The Anteaters head is caught in it, and falling down, she is ordered by the lynx to become altogether an Anteater, and to live in a hole. After this, the lynx takes back the young springbok to her mother, and becomes himself (by the order of the anteater) a lynx who eats springbok, and married a lynx. This account is again followed by the anteaters laws concerning the habits of various animals, such as the jackal, the 'Loffelhund' (Proteles), etc., who were, once upon a time, men.

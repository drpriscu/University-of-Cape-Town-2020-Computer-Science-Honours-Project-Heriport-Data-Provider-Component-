  <dc:description>About the dream (or ||gan-a) of !nanni and Tamme's country. In !nanni's country a dream put 'a thing' into a person and this makes them ill. In Tamme's country, a dream speaks to him. The dream speaks to many people who hear it. The people told Tamme that when a person dies he or she becomes a dream (or ||gan-a). The dream's heart aches when this happens and kills another person (it puts a 'thing' in them).</dc:description>

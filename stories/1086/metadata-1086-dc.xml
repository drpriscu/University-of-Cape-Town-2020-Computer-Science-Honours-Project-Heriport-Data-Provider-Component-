  <dc:description>The !kun eat the Maiya raw when it is ripe. The unripe Maiya is put in the heated earth and then eaten. The odour of the skin (which is thrown away) makes dogs faint. There is an account of an incident in which a man becomes intoxicated and remains at his house and demands that the people beat his head (because the Maiya is 'killing' him). 1) p.9876v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu) and observed it himself, 2) p.9881v: about fearing death: a man who has a cold heart fears death whereas a man whose heart burns is not afraid to die, 3) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-11.</dc:description>

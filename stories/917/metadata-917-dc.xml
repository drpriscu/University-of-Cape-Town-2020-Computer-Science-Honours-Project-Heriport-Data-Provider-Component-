  <dc:description>About |han=kass'o's maternal grandfather Tsatsi (Tsa t'ssi), who was a passionate man (which is why he was never a 'sorcerer' or 'doctor'). He only ever listened to |han=kass'o's mother. Tsatsi said that his daughter had softened his heart towards the people as he would have shot at them, because they had not acted nicely in his opinion.</dc:description>

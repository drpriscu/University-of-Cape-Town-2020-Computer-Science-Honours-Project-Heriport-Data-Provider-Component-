  <dc:description>Dia!kwain's elder sister, |a-kkumm, comes upon an owl as she journeys from !kau-|nunu (Kenhardt) at sunset, and it behaves as if it is going to snatch her. When it leaves she is afraid because her mother had told her that when an owl leaves at sunset a beast of prey is near. 1) p.4868v: this story was told to Dia!kwain by |a-kkumm when he was little; about Kenhardt (or !kau-|nunu) at the time before the white people built their houses there, 2) pp.4869v-4879v: see Avoidance behaviour relating to lions, 3) See also |a khumm called by a lion, 4) This story is found in Book V-11.</dc:description>

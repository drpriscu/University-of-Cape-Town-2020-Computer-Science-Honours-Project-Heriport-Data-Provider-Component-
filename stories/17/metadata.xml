<title>The Lion becomes a star</title>
<summary>The (two) Lions, which was the name given to us (by our first informants) for the Pointers to the Southern Cross, were formerly men, and at the same time lions.  (LII. –1. 277 and 278)  One of them became a star, because a girl looked at him; and the other lion also became a star.  They now stand silent, not far from the lionesses, who sit silent. (L II.–1. 237–240).  A shorter notice (B I. 303) refers also to this conception; but there is evidently much more mythological fiction connected with these lions than we know; and it is probably on this account that the meaning of what we have already noted down is not yet clear to us.<i> –The names  of the two Lions are !gu and !háuë ta #hóu. The Lion becomes a star and stands in the sky.</i></summary><comments>1) See also <i>The two Lions: pointers to the Southern Cross</i> and <i>The Lion star</i> (in Lloyd&apos;s notebooks), 2) This story is found in Book I</comments><date>1871</date><storypages>303</storypages><category>History (Early Race)</category><category>Celestial bodies and aeroscopy</category><author>|a!kunta (Stoffel) (I)</author><keyword><kw>star</kw><subkw>the Lion becomes a</subkw></keyword>

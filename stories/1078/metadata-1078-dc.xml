  <dc:description>When a woman's husband dies, the widow is 'taken' by the dead man's younger or next brother. In this way her children are brought up with a father ('nicely'). When this man also dies the wife lies down and sleeps alone. Her son goes away and marries and the widow has to rely on her daughter to give her food, wood and water. A man comes to take her daughter away to live as his wife in another country.</dc:description>

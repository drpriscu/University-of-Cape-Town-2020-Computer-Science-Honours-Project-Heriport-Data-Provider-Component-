  <dc:description>An Elephant carries away the little Springbok on her back while |kaggen (the Mantis) is inside a hole digging for food. |kaggen calls to the little Springbok from inside the hole but it does not answer him. The Elephant-calf answers him instead, but not with a nice sound. |kaggen thinks that the soil he has thrown out of the hole has stuck in the little Springbok's throat. |kaggen emerges from the hole to see why the child's throat sounds as it does. He finds the Elephant-calf lying there covered with soil from the hole, strikes the calf and knocks it down, killing it. |kaggen tracks the departed Elephant by its spoor but decides to return home to tell his sister (who is the Blue Crane) about the theft of the child. The sister scolds him for sleeping in the hole and not hearing what occurred. |kaggen asks for food so that he may follow the Elephant to its place. He tells his sister she must watch for when the grass blows from another direction, for that is when he will return with the child. He finds the Elephant's house and sees the little Springbok playing with the Elephant children, and calls out to it. The Elephant sees |kaggen coming and swallows the Springbok child. |kaggen demands that the Elephant give the child back and enters her navel to fetch the child, whom he fastens onto his back. The other people try to stab |kaggen to death, so he exits through the Elephant's trunk and flies away to return the child to his sister. The pet springbok of the Mantis carried off by an Elephant, while the Mantis is in a hole, digging out sweet food for it,-the Elephant substitutes her own calf,-the inarticulate reply of the latter to the questions of the Mantis leads to the discovery of the deception,-the Mantis kills the calf and follows the spoor of its mother.  He recognizes his pet, who is immediately swallowed by the mother Elephant,-dialogue,-entry of the Mantis into the body of the elephant, notwithstanding the attacks of her companions,-death of the elephant,-rescue of the young springbok,-triumphant departure of the Mantis with his pet, through the midst of the angry and threatening elephants. This myth is in the Katkop dialect, and was told to Dia!kwain by his mother #kamme-an.  It is partly written down by L. (B XXV. 2416-2424, 2429-2431, 2433 and 2434, XXVI.2435-2473).</dc:description>

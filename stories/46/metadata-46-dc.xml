  <dc:description>A lion sees the hyena carry away a gemsbok to give to her children waiting in the hole. It goes to head her off but the hyena bites the lion's thigh and it screams in pain. The hyena carries off the gemsbok and leaves the lion, who goes into some thorn bushes where |a!kunta's paternal grandfather Griesbaart sees it. The hyena goes out looking for ostrich eggs which she takes home to her children. There follows a discussion of how they drink the egg-liquid and a general account of the finding and drinking of eggs.</dc:description>

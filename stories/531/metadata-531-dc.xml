  <dc:description>Death. The stars know the time at which a Bushman dies, and the fall of one announces, to those who are not aware of it, that something bad has happened.  When, after this, a 'Hammerkop' (Scopus umbretta), flies, calling out over the Bushmen, the people know that someone belonging to them has died. Girls who have been killed by lightning are changed into stars. Girls who have been taken away by the water become like a beautiful water-flower, which will not allow itself to be plucked, and disappears when approached. Such flowers must be let alone. The place in the sky in which lightning appears should be looked at, so that the lightning may not kill us by stealth. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (L V.-22. 5776-5809).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The name of the Lion not to be spoken by children. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain, from =kamme-an (L V.-7. 4526 and 4526, 8. 4527-4562). Another version of this warning (L V.-8. 4563-4573). The |xam avoid saying the lion's name so the flies cannot hear and report to the lion what they say; some of the lion's habits when killing game; what people must do when stealing game from a lion; they make signs or hand gestures to signify the lion instead of saying its name. 1) p.4525v: this story was 'taught' to Dia!kwain by his mother (=kamme-an), 2) p.4531v: a description of the hand gesture used to signify the lion (Dia!kwain made the gesture by way of illustration), 3) p.4544v: a note on a story told by a Mr Schreuder, 4), p.4558v: the lion is cunning; Dia!kwain's mother told him to cut quickly then leave the lion's 'killing place', 5) See also The children taught to use another name for the lion, 6) This story is found in Books V-7 and V-8.</dc:description>

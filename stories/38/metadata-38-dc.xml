  <dc:description>) |kaggen (the Mantis) talks to his belongings. He carries them in a sack made from hartebeest skin (the 'Hartebeest's children').  He fights with !goe !kweitentu (eyes-in-feet) who beats him, scarring his head. |kaggen springs into the water to cool his wounds. His 'arms' feathers' are wet and float off in the water. |kaggen becomes human. Ichneumon advises him that the best way to attack !goe !kweitentu is to go for his eyes which are in his feet. So |kaggen beats !goe !kweitentu's feet, beating dust into his eyes. |kaggen's things wait for him in his house. |kaggen's wife |huntu !kat !katten (the Dassie) waits there too and heals the wounds in his head when he returns. |kaggen dreams of the hunt in the morning, as he is hungry. He wants to take !kuken !kakka !ani's eggs and does so. His wife says he is unwise to take the eggs and that he must return them for they will all go hungry because of his actions. (A section of the story not translated.) |kaggen is going along with |kwammana to his home when he leaves |kwammana to go to the |gipps' (Striped Jackals') house. The |gipps throw |kaggen into the fire and hold him down. They hammer coals onto his body. |kaggen burns in the fire and calls to his 'hartebeest's children (his things), and with his 'arms' feathers' flies into the sky. He goes into the water and the hot stones fall off him. He emerges from the water as a man. He puts on his things. Ichneumon laughs at |kaggen because he has seen him without his things and is not deceived by him. |kaggen returns home to |huntu !kat !katten and his fire. (A section of the story not translated.) |kaggen tells of hunting the Ostrich (who is different) and its eggs, and how he was cheated by his own arrow which turned around on him as he tried to shoot a hare. He recounts the story of his fight with !goe !kweitentu. Among the fights which the Mantis has with different personages and animals, one of the most interesting to the Bushman mind, is that with a being whose eyes are in his feet, instead of his head, which is smooth. Its unusual name is !goe-kweitentu, - but it has others, one of which seems identical with the Bushman name for the Ignis fatuus. This personage, in the first instance, gives the Mantis a severe beating, but the latter, obtaining advice from his grandson, the Ichneumon, with regard to the proper method of attacking this foe, is ultimately victorious.  Of this myth we have three versions; a short one (L II.-9. 935-966), a long one (B II.391-420, III. 461-500, XI.1027-1119, XII. 1121-1170, XIX.1805-1871, XX. 1872-1964, again pp.1805-1816, 1872-1910, 2060-2152</dc:description>

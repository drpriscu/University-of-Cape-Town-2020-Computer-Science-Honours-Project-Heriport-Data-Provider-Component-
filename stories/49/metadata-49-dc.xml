  <dc:description>An episode in the myth of the Dawns-Heart, called The Black Crow calling the Jackal (when she had been mocked by the Dawns-Heart-child), is given separately, in a yet unfinished piece, in which the Jackal talks with its peculiar click. (B IX.921-930). The Black Crow calls the Jackal and the Jackal comes. Day's Heart's child mocks the Jackal and they both get angry. The Jackal calls the Blue Crane and they look for the child. The Jackal wants to make the child her daughter. The Blue Crane goes along singing with the Krieboom on her shoulder. She arrives where Day's Heart's child sits and agrees with the Jackal that the child is 'not a little white'. 1) 'Day's Heart' is also known as 'Dawn's Heart', 2) This story is found in Book IX.</dc:description>

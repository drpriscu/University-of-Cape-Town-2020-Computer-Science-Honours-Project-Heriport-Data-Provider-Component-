  <dc:description>In the Early Times, when people were springboks, they cried like children when |kaggen (the Mantis) shot them. |kaggen said they should become people because of how they cried. ...It was also stated by him that the Bushmen were formerly Springbok, and were changed into Bushmen by the Mantis (L VIII.-4. 6365 rev.). 1) This story is found in Book VIII-4.</dc:description>

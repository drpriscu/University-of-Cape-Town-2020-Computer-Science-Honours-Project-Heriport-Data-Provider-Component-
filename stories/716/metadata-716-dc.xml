  <dc:description>The hunter is unable to kill a springbok if his companion has been killed. His arrows miss the springbok and if an arrow does hit the springbok it runs on as if not wounded. The women shave parts of the hunter's head (over the temples). This ensures that the springbok will come straight up to the hunters so they can shoot it at close range.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The vicious Water-tortoise and the charitable Ratel (Mellivora), a fable related to Dia!kwain, by his mother (L V.-5. 4265-4291). The Ratel comes upon the Waterskilpad (or Water Tortoise) who says that it is ill and needs its neck rubbed. The Ratel is eventually persuaded to stroke the Tortoise's neck folds and his hands and feet are trapped inside. This is why the Ratel's claws are long. 1) p.4264v: This story was told to Dia!kwain by his mother (=kamme-an); the Waterskilpad is also known as the Great Waterskilpad or Great Tortoise, 2) See also The story of the Leopard Tortoise and A further explanation of the ratel (or Mellivora): why it is like a man, 3) This story is found in Book V-5.</dc:description>

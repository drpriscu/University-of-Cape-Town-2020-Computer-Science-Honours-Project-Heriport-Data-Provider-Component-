People who die of 'sorcery' without feeling ill and how sorcerers strengthen their senses. They are not ordinary people. 1) p.6007v: Dia!kwain heard this story from his mother (=kamme-an); a note on the thing held by the dancer in Orpen's picture seen in Cape Monthly Magazine (of July 1874); the |xam and Dutch name of a tortoise-shell in which buchu is kept; see Jan Plat's aunt Natta sang the =gebbi-ggu (see also p.6006v), 2) p.6008v: |xam names for animals (namely tortoises), 3) See also Mr G.

  <dc:description>The Story of !ko-g!nuin-tara, wife of the 'Dawns-Heart' Star. By /han=kasso (L VIII.--7. 8393-8432). In a note, in English, after the same narrator, the younger sister of !ko-g!nuin-tara is stated to belong to the Early Race (which preceded the Bushmen in their country), (L VIII.-6. 6546 rev., note). The She-Hyena (who is jealous of !ko'-g !nuin-tara and her child) poisons !ko'-g !nuin-tara and she becomes a Lynx and trots away into the reeds. The She-Hyena adorns herself in !ko'-g !nuin-tara's ornaments and marries the Day's Heart star. The Day's Heart asks why his wife is not attending to the child. The younger sister goes to !ko'-g !nuin-tara so that she may feed her child, but !ko'-g !nuin-tara's memory of who she is becomes increasingly vague, and she advises her sister to no longer come. Meanwhile, the Day's Heart has discovered the deception and goes to his wife in the reeds. She charges out of the reeds, but stops for one of the goats that they have brought with them. The people hold her down and anoint her with goat's blood and she is returned to normal, except for her ears which remain long and pointed so that she can retain her good hearing. 1) p.8231v: |han=kass'o heard this story from his mother (|xabbi-an) and from his maternal grandmother (=kammi), 2) p.8393v: the |xam name for a female hyena, 3) p.8394v: the names of the people who gave the poison to !ko'-g !nuin-tara, 4) p.8395v: the !huin plant and how it is eaten, 5) p.8398v: names for pieces of meat taken from the thigh of an animal; see Eating hare's meat, 6) p.8399v: (21 May 1879) see Wildcat turns into a lion; and 8400v: see Dead people are those who rode the rain, 7) p.8401v: the name of a water-pool with and without bushes, 8) p.8406v: see How children are carried, 9) p.8407v: the |xam term for 'to forget', 10) p.8414v: the dance or game called the !ku (which |han=kass'o has not seen, but heard of from relatives), 11) p.8429v: |han=kass'o demonstrates the tufts of hair on the lynx's ears with his fingers, 12) See also The Day's Heart star and More about the Day's Heart star: what he says to his daughter, 13) This story is found in Book VIII-27.</dc:description>

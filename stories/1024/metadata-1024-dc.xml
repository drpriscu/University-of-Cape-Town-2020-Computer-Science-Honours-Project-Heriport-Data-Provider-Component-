  <dc:description>|xue becomes tchaxa (two of them). |xue's wife makes a hole in the smaller tchaxa and eats it (it is full of juice). |xue's wife makes a hole in the larger tchaxa but drops it because it is heavy. |xue falls out and his wife slaps |xue and scolds him, warning him that he will get killed in the form of one of these different things. He runs away to hide in a different place, where he becomes an elephant and vultures (=nue) eat him. The father-in-law cuts at the elephant but the knife breaks, so the daughter fetches a larger knife to give to her father.  [The ending is inconclusive.] 1) Lloyd notes in pencil on p.9348v that this story is 'probably' continued on p.9359, 2) Tamme heard this story from his paternal grandfather (Nakua or Nakka), 3) p.9358v: greetings in !kun (from !nanni and Tamme), 4) p.9360v: see Bushman groups, 5) p.9377v: Tamme's paternal grandfather saw |xue, 6) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-5.</dc:description>

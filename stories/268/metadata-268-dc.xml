  <dc:description>||kabbos 'Dream of lions which talked', and also of his wife !kwabba-an, who asked him why he had not yet returned to her. This followed by a description of his and |a!kuntas morning work (L ll.-22. 1949-1964). ||kabbo (Jantje Tooren) describes the lions and how they follow the spoor of a springbok. When he sleeps again he dreams of his wife, who asks ||kabbo for tobacco which he does not have but he gives her a pipe. She asks why he hasn't returned to her and he tells her he has been teaching. He tells her |han=kass'o was to have brought her to him, but then he is woken by the cow's horns knocking on the house. He dreams of his family and about the work he does at the house in Mowbray, and then day breaks.</dc:description>

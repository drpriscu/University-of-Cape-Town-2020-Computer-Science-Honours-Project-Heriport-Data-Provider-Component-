  <dc:description>A girl of the ancient race (preceding the Bushmen) wished for a little light, so that the people might see to return home by night.  She, therefore, threw wood-ashes into the sky, which became the Milky Way. This myth, which //kabbo heard from his mother !kwi-an (L II.-28. 2505-2516), is followed by an account of the same girl, who, being vexed with her mother for giving her too little of a certain red edible root, threw up portions of it into the sky, where they became stars (L II.-28.  2516-2520). A verso note on p.2516v describes how this girl (the new maiden) made locusts by throwing the peel of the !kui ssi that she was eating into the sky. Another note describes how she threw up the !huin roots to make stars. The red (or old) !huin made red stars and the white or young !huin made white stars.</dc:description>

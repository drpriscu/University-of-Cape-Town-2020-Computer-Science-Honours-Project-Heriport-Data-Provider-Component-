  <dc:description>The |kaggen (or the mantis) that sits on the hunter's quiver foretells that the owner has successfully shot and killed a hartebeest on the hunting-ground. If the hunter's wife kills or drives away the |kaggen the hartebeest will recover and live because it, as well as the |kaggen, has not been respected. The game must be respected in order to kill it successfully.</dc:description>

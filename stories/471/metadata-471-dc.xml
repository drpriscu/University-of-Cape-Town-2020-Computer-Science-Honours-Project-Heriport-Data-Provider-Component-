  <dc:description>The |kaggen (or the mantis) that sits on the hunter's quiver foretells that the owner has successfully shot and killed a hartebeest on the hunting-ground. If the hunter's wife kills or drives away the |kaggen the hartebeest will recover and live because it, as well as the |kaggen, has not been respected. The game must be respected in order to kill it successfully. 1) pp.5173-5260 were translated in April 1912; except for pp.5206-5209, 2) Date on p.5261: 14 September;  p.5296: 22 September, 3) An insert pasted on the inside of the back cover (of Book V-16): appears to be the last sentence of p.5260 and concerns |kaggen (the Mantis), 4) See also The Moon, 5) p.5299v: Dia!kwain heard this story from his mother (â‰ kamme-an) and father (Xaa-ttin) , 6) This story is found in Books V-16 and V-17.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Bushman Doctor or Sorcerer (L II.-1. 273-275).  An account of these people was also given in the Katkop dialect by Dia!kwain (L V.-3. 4122-4131), from whom we besides have two reports of cures performed upon himself. The first of these (L V.-3. 4132-4161, 4. 4162-4199) includes a speech made by the sorceress; the second relates how she cured him when injured by a Kafir (L V.-4. 4200-4230). When the healer (!gixa) returns home after doing his work he 'trembles' and the people give him buchu to smell to make his 'vertebral artery' lie back down. A new healer has other healers' 'work' 'snored in to his veins so that he too can 'snore' ill people. 1) p.4121v: Dia!kwain heard about this from his mother (=kammi-an), but also saw it for himself; the |xam names of veins; Dr Stewart was consulted on the 'vertebral artery', 2) p.4126v: Dia!kwain says that there would be a 'spring' of blood inside the body, or internal bleeding from the 'vertebral artery', 3) See also The tale of a wise person or sorceress, what she said, when she talked with us and The story of a sorceress; that which she did when the Kafir had hurt my throat, she 'snored' me, when my throat was swollen and About the 'Toornan': the Bushman witchdoctor, 4) This story is found in Book V-3.</dc:description>

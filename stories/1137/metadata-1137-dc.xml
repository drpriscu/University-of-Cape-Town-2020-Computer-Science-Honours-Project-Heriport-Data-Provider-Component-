  <dc:description>A Koranna makes a fire which attracts cattle. He asks the Bushman if he wants the thing that shines or the blackness. The Bushman says 'what shines is mine' and the Koranna says 'mine is the blackness'. When day breaks that which shone is gone and the Bushman appears to leave as if upset ('as if thou wert vexed with me'). This is why the Koranna possess cattle and the Bushmen go without cattle.</dc:description>

He trips and wounds his knee and the pot breaks. He leaves the ox-head in the tree and departs for his mother's country with a bag of !naxane. The people hide from |xue. |xue searches for his people in vain, and turns back crying. 1) p.9803v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu); !nanni made a clay model of the ox-head featured in his story (in the Iziko collection), 2) p.9807v: a reference to one of !nanni's drawings of 16 May 1881 (either Iziko_SAMLB_!nBook1_001 or 002) and some of the names of a bird, 3) p.9809v: see Names of seasons, 4) 9816v: (21 May 1881) see Respecting the eland, 5) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-10.</dc:description>

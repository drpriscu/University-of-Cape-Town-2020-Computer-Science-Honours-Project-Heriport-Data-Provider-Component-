  <dc:description>A story about the wind and the rain and the hunting of springbok. People who live facing the rain get their weapons wet, causing bowstrings to break. When the children shoot windward at the herd of springbok, they quickly turn and run leeward. The speaker intends to go and wait at the springbok's water-course or footpaths where they will turn and run along. The springbok must be driven by the women in the evening because they go leeward and behave better when it is cool.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The veritable Hottentot myth of the Origin of Death is told in the Katkop dialect by #kasin, whose father was a Hottentot; and, although the narrator says that he heard the story from his mother, a Bushwoman, its Hottentot origin can hardly be doubted.  Here, the Moon sends the Hare to men with the message of the renewal of life; but it reverses it into a message of death. The angered Moon then heats a stone, and burns the Hares mouth, causing the harelip. - =kasin told this story three times; -once in a very short version (B XXV. 2361-2364), secondly, in a little longer one (L IV.4. 3882-3885), and thirdly, in a still more extended one (L IV. -4. 3890-3900). The Moon sends the Hare to tell the people who are ill that they will live again like he does. The Hare changes the Moon's words and tells the people that they will stay dead and vanish from the earth when they die. The angry Moon punishes the Hare by burning his mouth. 1) There are three versions of this story in this notebook (IV-4); see also Story of the Moon and the Hare: a version at first by =kasin and then by Dia!kwain and Story of the Moon and the Hare: a version by Dia!kwain, 2) p.3889v: this version of the story was told to =kasin by his mother (kwa =ko, a |xam woman), 3) p.3896v: the stone (which the Moon uses to burn the Hare's mouth) is used heated by the |xam to make arrows and called Bui Klip in Dutch, 4) This story is found in Book IV-4.</dc:description>

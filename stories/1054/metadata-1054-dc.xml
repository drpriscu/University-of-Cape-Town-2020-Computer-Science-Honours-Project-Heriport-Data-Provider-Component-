  <dc:description>|xue journeys to his country (and his mother's and father's country) and searches for his father. He hears two people coming, so he becomes many !naxane leaves. The people see |xue's fire and search for him and |xue changes into !naxane fruit. The people want to eat the fruit, but |xue becomes many butterflies and the people run away. |xue changes back to a |xue-child and lies down, crying for the people to pick him up. The people hide from |xue. |xue stops being the Sun but becomes a little fly, and then a large black butterfly. He calls for the women to pour their (women's) milk into his eye, but they pour badly and |xue can only see from one eye. |xue 'works' rain to fall on the women. He sounds a |ou's horn (the |ou is a small buck, probably a steenbok) and 'works' fire and the fire burns for many months. |xue climbs a palm tree and sleeps at the top of it. |xue's wife chops the tree down despite his protests. [This story was supposed to 'be continued' (page 9616v) but appears not to have been.] 1) p.9601v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu), 2) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-8.</dc:description>

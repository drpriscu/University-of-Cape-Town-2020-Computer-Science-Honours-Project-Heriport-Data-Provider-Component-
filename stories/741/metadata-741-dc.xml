  <dc:description>A young woman of the Early Race is carried off by the Rain in the form of a bull. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-16. 7434-7448). The Rain courted a young woman of the Early Race, because of her scent. The young woman climbs onto the Rain's back and he starts to take her away to his home (the water-pit). The young woman rubs buchu on the Rain, which makes him fall asleep and she steals away from the Rain and returns home. 1) |han=kass'o heard this from his mother (|xabbi-an), 2) p.7434v: the rain's 'breath' resembles mist (or |khumm), 3) p.7435v: the rain's scent smells sweet, 4) p.7436v: the rain resembles a bull which is his body, 5) p.7441v: the 'River-bed people' call the dassie's home in the rocks a 'hole', 6) p.7442v: dry things are 'rubbed' and wet things are 'anointed', 7) This story is found in Book VIII-16.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Moon tells the Hare to inform people that they must return to life after dying, as he does, but the Hare gets the story wrong and tells people that they are 'thoroughly' dead when dead. The Moon fights the Hare with a heated stone, burning his mouth and leaving a wound on the Hare's lip. The veritable Hottentot myth of the  Origin of Death  is told in the Katkop dialect by #k sin, whose father was a Hottentot; and, although the narrator says that he heard the story from his mother yoa  ko, a Bushwoman, its Hottentot origin can hardly be doubted.  Here, the Moon sends the Hare to men with the message of the renewal of life; but it reverses it into a message of death. The angered Moon then heats a stone, and burns the Hare s mouth, causing the harelip.   #k sin, told this story three times;  once in a very short version (B XXV. 2361 2364), and thirdly, in a still more extended one (L IV.  4. 3890 3900).</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The veritable Hottentot myth of the Origin of Death is told in the Katkop dialect by #kasin, whose father was a Hottentot; and, although the narrator says that he heard the story from his mother yoa =ko, a Bushwoman, its Hottentot origin can hardly be doubted.  Here, the Moon sends the Hare to men with the message of the renewal of life; but it reverses it into a message of death. The angered Moon then heats a stone, and burns the Hares mouth, causing the harelip. - #kasin, told this story three times; -once in a very short version (B XXV. 2361-2364), and thirdly, in a still more extended one (L IV. -4. 3890-3900). The Moon tells the Hare to inform people that they must return to life after dying, as he does, but the Hare gets the story wrong and tells people that they are 'thoroughly' dead when dead. The Moon fights the Hare with a heated stone, burning his mouth and leaving a wound on the Hare's lip. 1) Namaqua vocabulary appears on many of the verso pages of this story, 2) This story is found in Book XXV.</dc:description>

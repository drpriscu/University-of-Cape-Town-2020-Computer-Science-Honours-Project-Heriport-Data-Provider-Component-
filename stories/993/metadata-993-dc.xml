  <dc:description>When one of the !kun dies, the other people dig a hole in the earth and place the dead person inside it. When a man dies, his bow and stick are put into his grave with him. The grave is covered up with earth. Another man takes the dead man's arrows. After the people have buried the dead person they leave for another place (or 'country'). They do this because they fear or respect death and the dead person.</dc:description>

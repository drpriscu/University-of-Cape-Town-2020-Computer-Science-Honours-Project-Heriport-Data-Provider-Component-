  <dc:description>A note has been made, from //kabbos information, of a story not yet written down in Bushman, telling how the Rain carried off a girl belonging to the First Bushmen (or the ancient people living before the Bushmen), who afterwards became a frog, her kaross being changed into a springbok, etc. Her people were also transformed (L II.-37. 3335 rev. and 3336 rev.). Versions of this transformation into frogs, ascribed chiefly to a New Maidens acts of disobedience, are given in the Katkop dialect by !kweiten ta ||ken (L VI.-1. 3930-3958), and by Dia!kwain (B XXVII. 2609-2618, continued in L V.-2. 3864-3881). Three maidens get caught in the rain. Two of the older girls glide across the Rain's back safely, but the third girl is a new maiden and falls into the spring and becomes a frog. The water-hole's name is |kannu.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The people of !nanni's country do not kill the snake that is found near a grave, because the snake is the dead person's snake and it is the spirit of the dead. Similarly the people do not kill other animals (such as antelope and lizards) which are found near graves. They are considered to be spirit-animals or spirits of the dead. 1) 9956v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu), 2) 9956v-9957v: see Snakes and spirits of the dead and A certain snake, which, by lying upon its back, announces a death in the family; and must not, in these circumstances, be killed, 3) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-12.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>At sunset |xue becomes |xue and lies on the ground and sleeps on his own. At sunrise he awakens and sees the sun and becomes ||gui (a tree). His wife sees the ||gui and picks some of its fruit. The ||gui vanishes and |xue becomes a fly instead. |xue's wife is upset about the ||gui vanishing and lies on the ground to cry. |xue in the form of the fly settles on the grass (called go o). 1) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-5.</dc:description>

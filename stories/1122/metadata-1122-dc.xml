  <dc:description>!nauxa (or Willem) is accompanied by his !Ora, or Hottentot, companion, !khannumup (or Petros Willems). He tells Lloyd his mother's and father's names, the name of his people ('Grass Bushmen', or |nu'sa'), the names of some mountains near his country, and other personal details. The two men were photographed by Hermann, apparently on the same day of the interview, at the South African Museum.</dc:description>

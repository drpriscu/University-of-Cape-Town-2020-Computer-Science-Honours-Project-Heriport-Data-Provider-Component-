<title>|xue and his parents and child</title>
<summary>|xue, both his wives and his child inflict various forms of violence on each other. In the course of the story |xue becomes a number of people all at once to beat his wives and child. When he has died, |xue&apos;s father makes a grave for |xue. |xue&apos;s father and father-in-law put |xue into the grave. |xue cries out for them to leave him alone. |xue&apos;s father-in-law burns his eyes with fire and his mother beats |xue&apos;s father-in-law with a stick. The father-in-law shoots |xue&apos;s father with an arrow, killing him. |xue lies on the ground crying for his dead father. At sunset |xue&apos;s father returns to life and pursues |xue to beat him. |xue&apos;s father ties him up in a skin and carries him home. |xue&apos;s mother tries to give |xue food but his father says she must not. |xue lies silently on the ground and then shoots his father. |xue, his father and his mother continue to beat each other up. |xue goes into a mouse-hole and bites his father, breaking his &apos;first fore-finger&apos;. |xue&apos;s father beats |xue as he runs into the mouse-hole, breaking off a horn that he has tied to his back.

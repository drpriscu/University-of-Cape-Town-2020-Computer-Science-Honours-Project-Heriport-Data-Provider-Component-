  <dc:description>The Knorhaan (Brandkop) who married his sister. Told to Dia!kwain by his mother (L V.-5. 4292-4320).  Apparently a version of the fable imbedded in the Anteaters Laws. The Kwa-kkwara (or Koran Brandkop) pretends to be a child and cries and hides his 'grown-up things'. A girl carries him about and he sleeps with her. The girl's mother tells the girl's older brother who puts the Kwa-kkwara's head into the fire. Kwa-kkwara screams ('||kha! ||kha!') and darts out of the fire, revealing himself to be a grown-up man. 1) This story was told to Dia!kwain by his mother (=kamme-an), 2) This story contains a rare reference to sex in the Lloyd notebooks, 3) The bird in the story's Dutch name is Koran Brandkop, 4) p.4293v: some |xam words for relations, 5) See also The Korhaan marries his elder sister (the Anteater's laws) (||kabbo's version 2) and The song of the Kwa-Kkwara, or korhaan malkop and The kwa-kkwara, or korhaan malkop, 4) This story is found in Book V-5.</dc:description>

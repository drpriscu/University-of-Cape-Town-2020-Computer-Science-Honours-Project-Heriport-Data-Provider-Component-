  <dc:description>An ignorant man having gone to dig up Sho-!oa, is discovered speechless and motionless, sitting among serpents, by the hole where he had been digging. By a skilful application of Sho-!oa, the snakes are driven away, taking with them the scent which had injured the man, but leaving the other scent with the plant in the hole. The man is (also by Sho-|oa) restored to speech and motion (L. II.-36. 3287-3332). The scent of the Ssho |oa plant is then taken away by snakes (which go into the hole that the Ssho |oa was dug out of). The notes accompanying this story describe other things relating to Ssho |oa, such as the Ssho |oa snake. The people never kill Ssho |oa snakes. ||kabbo was told not to dig for Ssho |oa because he didn't have the neccessary marks.</dc:description>

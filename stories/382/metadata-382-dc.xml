  <dc:description>A child is hungry and stays awake crying in the night while the parents sleep. A lion hears her and comes into the house. The child takes dried grass from their bedding and sets the lion on fire and it runs away, setting bushes alight as it goes. Her parents reward her with food and the lion dies of its burns.</dc:description>

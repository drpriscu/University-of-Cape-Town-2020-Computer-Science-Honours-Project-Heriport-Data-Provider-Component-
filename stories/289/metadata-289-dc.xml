  <dc:description>//kabbos intended return home. He awaits the Moon that he may return, and hear the Bushman stories. Here he works womans work, while his comrades at home hear histories that travel; but he does not visit, as they do. The people down here do not talk his language; they visit their like, and are work-people who keep houses in order, and plant food. The Flat Bushmen visit and smoke at each others houses, and listen to histories. On his return to Bushmanland, he intends to put his former house in order, and reassemble his children. He inherited his place, and brought his wife to it (L II.-32. 2874-2925 rev.). ||kabbo explains that 'a story is like the wind' on p.2875v.</dc:description>

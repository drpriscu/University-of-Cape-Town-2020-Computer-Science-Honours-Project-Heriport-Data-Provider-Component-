  <dc:description>The youth of the early race, who saved the lives of the people at home by warning them of the approach of a Koranna war party. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-25. 8251-8261, 26. 8262-8268). A youth of the Early Race is seen by a commando of Korannas, so he acts as if he were a little child ('swaying about'). There is some debate among the Korannas as to whether to kill the child or not, but eventually they help him load up his water bottles and send him on his way. He returns home and tells his people what he has seen, and they leave for the mountains. The Korannas come, believing the people to still be there. 1) |han=kass'o heard this from his mother (|xabbi-an), 2) p.8260v: names for and descriptions of various birds and plants in Bushmanland, 4) pp.8266v &amp; 8267v: see A person who takes snuff: tobacco eats up his brains, 5) See also The escape of |kannan from the Koranna commando, 6) This story is found in Books VIII-25 and VIII-26.</dc:description>

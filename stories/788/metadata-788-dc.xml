  <dc:description>...the visit of //khwai-hemm (the All-devourer) to the Mantis. The latter, by means of the Porcupine, invites //khwai-hemm to visit him. He comes, and presently swallows /kwammana and the Mantis. They are rescued by young /kwammana and another child, who cut the monster open (L VIII.-20. 7812-7816, 22. 7906-7956). //khwai-hemm is stated, by /han=kasso (on the information of his mother /kabbi-an), to be the father of the Porcupine (L VIII.-10. 6934 rev., note). |kaggen (the Mantis) tells the Porcupine (his son's wife) to go to her father (||khwai-hemm), but she is afraid because there is not enough to feed him. ||khwai-hemm says that he will visit |kaggen, because he must have enough food to offer if he has invited ||khwai-hemm. ||khwai-hemm comes and |kaggen tells him to stop eating things, as there is nothing else to eat. ||khwai-hemm becomes angry and swallows |kwammana and then |kaggen. The children then each cut open a different side of ||khwai-hemm's body, and |kwammana and |kaggen fall out.|kaggen (the Mantis) tells the Porcupine (his son's wife) to go to her father (||khwai-hemm), but she is afraid because there is not enough to feed him. ||khwai-hemm says that he will visit |kaggen, because he must have enough food to offer if he has invited ||khwai-hemm. ||khwai-hemm comes and |kaggen tells him to stop eating things, as there is nothing else to eat. ||khwai-hemm becomes angry and swallows |kwammana and then |kaggen.

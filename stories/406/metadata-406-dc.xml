  <dc:description>The Lion jealous of the voice of the Ostrich. In the Katkop dialect by Dia!kwain, who heard it from his paternal grandfather, (L V.-5. 4320-4344). The Lions wish to kill the Ostrich and eat its lungs whole and raw so that they can call in the same attractive way. One of the Lions fights the Ostrich but does not kill it at this time. Dia!kwain and the other children are advised by Dia!kwain's grandfather to swallow the Ostrich's lungs whole and raw so that their voices can be fine, like that of the Ostrich. 1) p.4319v: this story was told to Dia!kwain by his Oud Tata (grandfather); when the Ostrich and the Lion were both people they roared the =gebbi-gu; accounting for a marking on the ostrich which people say is a scar left by the lion's nail, 2) p.4334v: at the time of the =gebbi-ggu's fight the Lion did not kill the Ostrich (but did so later when they were animals, and ate it), 3) See also Baboons and =gebbi-ggu and Baboons dance the =gebbi-gu and The |goo or =gebbi-gu, 4) This story is found in Book V-5.</dc:description>

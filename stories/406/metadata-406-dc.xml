  <dc:description>The Lion jealous of the voice of the Ostrich. In the Katkop dialect by Dia!kwain, who heard it from his paternal grandfather, (L V.-5. 4320-4344). The Lions wish to kill the Ostrich and eat its lungs whole and raw so that they can call in the same attractive way. One of the Lions fights the Ostrich but does not kill it at this time. Dia!kwain and the other children are advised by Dia!kwain's grandfather to swallow the Ostrich's lungs whole and raw so that their voices can be fine, like that of the Ostrich.</dc:description>

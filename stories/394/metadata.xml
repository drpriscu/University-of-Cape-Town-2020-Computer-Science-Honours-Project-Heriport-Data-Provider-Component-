<summary><i>An account of rain-making by means of dragging a water-animal over the land, in illustration of a Bushman painting copied by Mr J.M. Orpen (</i>Cape Monthly Magazine<i> for July, 1874, frontispiece), was given, in the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwãin, who had it from his mother (BXXVII. 2540-2608). The beginning of this was repeated by him (L V.-3. 4075-4085), and two other accounts of rain-making were also given by him (L V.-3. 4086-4121).</i> A story of a rainmaker (<i>!gixa</i>) called Kko-kkorro who was leading the waterbull by means of a thong placed on its horns to pull it along. The thong broke and the bull went into the water.</summary><comments>1) p.4085v: this story was told to Dia!kwain by his father (Xaa-ttin or Jacob); Kko kkoro (who told Dia!kwain&apos;s father the story) was an old man who could not speak Dutch and told Dia!kwain&apos;s father many things, 2) p.4086v: the musical instrument called<i> !kummi</i> and played by women, 3) p.4087v: another musical instrument called the bullroarer or <i>!go in-!go in,</i> which produces a whirring noise when played, 4) See also <i>A rain story </i>and<i> Rainmaking (a version by Dia!kwain) and Rainmaking: another story of it </i>and<i> Rainmaking</i>, 5) This story is found in Book V-3</comments><date>14 – 16 January 1875</date><storypages>4086-4089</storypages><category>The Rain and Rain&apos;s water</category><category>History (personal)</category><author>Dia!kwain (David Hoesar) (V)</author><keyword><kw>waterbull</kw><subkw>the water&apos;s bull</subkw></keyword>

  <dc:description>The Lion wants the Fieldmouse's chest, which is broader than his own, so that he may make a loader noise when roaring and people may fear him. The Lion feels that as he is the one feared by people he should have the bigger chest. He tells the Fieldmouse these things and the Mouse agrees. The Lion tests the Mouse's chest by roaring and approves. So the Lion goes about at night roaring with the Mouse's chest while the Fieldmouse inhabits a small hole on account of having the Lion's smaller chest.</dc:description>

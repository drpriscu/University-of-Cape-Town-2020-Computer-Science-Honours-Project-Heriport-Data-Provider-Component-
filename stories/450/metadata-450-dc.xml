  <dc:description>Dia!kwain's cousin, Ttai tchuen, escapes from a lioness by remembering all the things her parents taught her about the doings of lions. She acts fearlessly and shines a button at the lioness to dazzle her and twirls around to scare her out of the den. Ttai tchuen leaves her mat behind so that the lioness will think it is her. 1) p.4926v: Dia!kwain heard this story from Ttai tchuen herself, his first cousin and the daughter of one of his mother's brothers: she was 'white' like a Koranna woman and beautiful, 2) Date on p.4932: 9 July; p.4972: 12 July, 3) pp.4960v &amp; 4961v: the actions of lions who seek fights with or provoke people to strike them so that they can bite and kill them; lionesses with cubs are like dogs (affectionate), 4) This story is found in Book V-12.</dc:description>

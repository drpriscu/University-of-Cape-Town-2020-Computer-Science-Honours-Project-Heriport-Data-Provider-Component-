  <dc:description>A note has been made, from ||kabbos information, of a story not yet written down in Bushman, telling how the Rain carried off a girl belonging to the First Bushmen (or the ancient people living before the Bushmen), who afterwards became a frog, her kaross being changed into a springbok, etc. Her people were also transformed. (L II.-37. 3335 rev. and 3336 rev.)-Versions of this transformation into frogs, ascribed chiefly to a new Maidens acts of disobedience, are given in the Katkop dialect by !kweiten ta ||ken (L VI.-1. 3930-3958), and by Dia!kwain. (B XXVII. 2609-2618, continued in L V.-2. 3864-3881). A continuation of a previous story about new maidens (taken in W. Bleek's Book XXVII) in which a new maiden is punished and transformed into a frog when she goes to wash at the spring. This segment of the story accounts for the seclusion of  the new maiden in a hut and describes related customs. 1) This is a continuation of Bleek's story About new maidens in Book XXVII, pp.2609-2618, 2) p.3874v: Dia!kwain says that one gives the girl water in the same way that one would give drink to a small child, 3) p.3876v: Dia!kwain says that one feeds the girl small bite-sized pieces of food, but must not place them directly into her mouth, 4) See also The maiden's story; the Frog's story and A yet unwritten story, about the Rain and one of the First Bushmen girls carried away by a whirlwind and who became a frog, 5) This story is found in Book V-2.</dc:description>

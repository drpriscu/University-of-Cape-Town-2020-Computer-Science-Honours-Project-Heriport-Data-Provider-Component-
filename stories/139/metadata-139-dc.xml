  <dc:description>Words and sentences given by |a!kunta (Stoffel). 1) The first four notebooks were not numbered by Lloyd and contain mostly words and sentences and notes on clicks and pronunciation. Lloyd notes on the first page (p.1) of the first of these books that '... much of it I can even now see is very wrong; but I keep it partly for use, &amp; partly for the curiosity of the 1st attempt at hearing, this difficult language.', 2) There are notes containing information about |a!kunta (or Stoffel) inside the front cover of the first notebook, including where he came from (the Stormberg) and how many of |a!kunta's relations were also at the Breakwater Convict Station.</dc:description>

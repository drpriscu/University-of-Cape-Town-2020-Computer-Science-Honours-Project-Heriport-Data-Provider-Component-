  <dc:description>The |kain |kain bird stabs a girl in the breast when she lies ill. The |kain |kain rubs her blood on his nose and goes to another girl. The |kain |kains come to the house of |kaggen (the Mantis) and |kaggen tells the girl's mother to give her a knife to take to bed with her. The girl stabs the bird when it comes, and the other birds scatter and run away. The people remark that |kaggen warned them about the |kain |kain, even though he usually lies and teases.</dc:description>

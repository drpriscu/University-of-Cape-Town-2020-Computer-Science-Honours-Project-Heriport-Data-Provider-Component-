  <dc:description>The Moon becomes angry if people laugh at it, and goes into the sky (i.e. becomes eclipsed).  When its anger has cooled, and its heart is 'comfortable' again, it comes out (L II.-35. 3154 rev.-3156 rev.).  The Moon and the Sun used to be people and live on the earth. The Moon can understand what the people say about him and grows angry when he hears the children laugh at him, and goes into the sky. 1) This story occurs on the verso pages of The children of the First Bushmen (who preceded the Flat Bushmen in their country) throw up the sleeping Sun into the sky, 2) This story is found in Book II-35.</dc:description>

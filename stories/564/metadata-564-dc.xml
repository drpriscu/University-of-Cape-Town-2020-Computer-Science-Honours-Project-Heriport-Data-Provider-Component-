  <dc:description>A description of the preparation of Meal, from the !kauru ( . . . . . ) berries, was given, in the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain. This is said to have been done formerly by the Quagga, in the days when she was a woman, and carried a sieve (L V.-25. 5997 rev.-6001 rev., note). In Early Times the Quagga and the Baboon were people. The Quagga possessed a mat or a sieve that she used when making flour or meal out of roasted and ground-up berries.</dc:description>

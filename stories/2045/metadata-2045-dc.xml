  <dc:description>Notes made in Angola[?], 1925. Originally a visitor's book (pre-1918) and includes signatures of numerous well-known people (first 64 pages). A scrap of paper written by the library says !O !kun. Words and sentences and brief genealogies with names of people and their relations. Brief references to daily life of the people interviewed. Some of the clicks are different, for example what resembles an elongated 'S' [what I have as ].</dc:description>

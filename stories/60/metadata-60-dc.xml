  <dc:description>A man kills an Ostrich and takes the body home to his wife, who removes its feathers. A gust of wind carries a feather up into the sky after which it falls into the water and gets wet. Here it becomes an Ostrich again which then leaves the water. On land it grows and strengthens and calls loudly for wives. It marries the wives who then lay eggs. One wife lies on her egg while the male Ostrich guards the house from the Jackal and the Hyena who want to steal the eggs. The male Ostrich goes away and the Hyena frightens away the Ostrich wives, takes the eggs and puts them in the bushes. The Jackal fears the male Ostrich who kicks at her with his feet and runs away into the bushes. The Hyena thinks she has frightened away the Ostrich and may return to hunt for eggs, as she is hungry. The angry Ostrich confronts the Hyena, who runs away. The Hyena returns to the Ostrich's house to seek food.</dc:description>

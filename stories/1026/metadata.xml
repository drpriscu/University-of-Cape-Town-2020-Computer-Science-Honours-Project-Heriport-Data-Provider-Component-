<title>|xue is a spirit, and kills his child</title>
<summary>|xue becomes a spirit and kills his child. |xue&apos;s wife goes out and when she returns to the house she sees the dead child there and accuses |xue of killing it. She takes a fire stick and burns |xue with it. |xue cries out, runs away and climbs a tree. The sun sets and rises and sets and rises again and |xue descends the tree. |xue&apos;s wife speaks to her father who goes out searching for |xue and when he finds him he slaps |xue and then carries him home. There |xue&apos;s father-in-law throws a stick at him and |xue runs away. |xue becomes a little snake and bites the father-in-law, who cries out and then dies. |xue becomes a large fly and flies away, and as he does so the father-in-law rises again. |xue becomes a butterfly and then becomes |xue the man again. When he sees his wife&apos;s father alive again carrying a big stick he runs away.

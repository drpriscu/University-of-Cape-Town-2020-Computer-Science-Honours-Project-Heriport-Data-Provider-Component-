  <dc:description>Although the Mantis is apparently the most prominent figure in Bushmen mythology, and, at all events, the subject of the greatest number of myths, yet it does not seem that he is the object of any worship, or that prayers are addressed to him.  The heavenly bodies – Sun, Moon, and Stars – are, however, prayed to ... and thus the Bushmen are clearly to be included among the nations who have attained sidereal worship. The |xam pray to the Moon, but not the Sun. They raise their hand and speak, asking for success with hunting springbok, finding ostrich eggs and 'digging out' 'Bushman rice' the next day. The verso pages of this narrative provide further notes on the actions performed and what is said during the prayer.</dc:description>

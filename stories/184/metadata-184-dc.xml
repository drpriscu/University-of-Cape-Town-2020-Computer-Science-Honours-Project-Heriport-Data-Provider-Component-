  <dc:description>By a glance from the eye of a maiden (probably at a time when she would be usually kept in strict retirement) men became fixed in whatever position they then occupied, with whatever they were holding in their hands, etc., and became changed into trees which talked  (L II.-2. 295-305). A man climbs the mountain and stands playing his !goura. A new maiden looks at him with her 'maiden eyes' while she listens to him playing. He becomes a tree and is fastened to the ground where he stands. Another man stands fast with his weapons and belongings in his hands. The maiden also looks at and transfixes him. He is now a talking tree. 1) This story is found in Book II-2.</dc:description>

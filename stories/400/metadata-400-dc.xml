  <dc:description>The Bushman Doctor or Sorcerer (L II-1. 273-275). An account of these people was also given in the Katkop dialect by Dia!kwain (L V.-3. 4122-4131), from whom we besides have two reports of cures performed upon himself. The first of these (L V.-3. 4132-4161, 4. 4162-4199) includes a speech made by the sorceress; the second relates how she cured him when injured by a Kafir (L V.-4. 4200-4230). A black man attempts to take Dia!kwain's mother's iron spoons (left to her by her dead husband) and has harmed her family in other ways (the same man poisoned Dia!kwain's aunt). Dia!kwain fights him and afterwards his throat is sore and swollen from the fight. His worried mother asks an old healer (!kwarra-an) to 'snore' him. 1) p.4204v: Dia!kwain had been carrying ostrich eggs filled with water, and a gun, when the black man seized hold of  him, 2) p.4212v: the manner in which the ostrich collapses 'like a round stone' and dies, 3) See also The story of !kwarra-an the sorceress: what she said when she talked with us and how she cured Dia!kwain as a boy and About the sorceress !kwarra-an, 4) This story is found in Book V-4.</dc:description>

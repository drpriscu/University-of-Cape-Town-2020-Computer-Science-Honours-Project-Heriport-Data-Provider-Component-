  <dc:description>The Baboons are also said to assemble together and play at the =gebbi-ggu, at night, like the Bushmen, singing like the Bushman women, and imitating the songs which they have heard the people sing. (L V.-25. 5998-6005). When baboons live near people they watch them holding the =gebbi-ggu and sing the same tune the women sing. One baboon sings for the others to follow and the people also do it this way. 1) p.5997v: Dia!kwain heard this story from his father (Xaa-ttin), 2) =gebbi-ggu is spelt in various ways throughout the stories in which it occurs, for instance =gebbi-gu, 3) pp.5997v-6001v: (missing p.5999v) (20 February) A continuation of the story of the Quagga (see Quagga makes flour) who ate bitter bulle, 4) p.6000v: Dia!kwain says that in nature |kaggen (the Mantis) 'is the eland's' and not the Hartebeest's, 4) p.6005v: some of the positions and movements of the dancers of the =gebbi-ggu, 5) p.6006v: see Jan Plat's aunt Natta sang the =gebbi-ggu (see also p.6007v); the farmers call the =gebbi-ggu the |ki, 6) See also The story of the lions and the ostriches (when they were people) and Baboons and =gebbi-ggu, 7) This story is found in Book V-25.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Bushman genealogies, undated. Some brief descriptions and personal histories, such as where individuals worked, came from, who they married, how many children they had and so on. Information about different groups such as the 'Vaalpens'. Names of people according to huts they occupy (10 of them), also some numbers next to their names. On the first page it reads '13 Leeuwen St. Cape Town'. A reference to type faces, and what looks to eb a phone number of 'Mr Bain Bushman Camp'. On the back page (upside down) it reads 'Theal vol II before 1795' with references to an index, plus a note about the 'van Riebeeck Society Vol. 15' and 2 names [?]. Some pages are blank and some have been scribbled in, probably by the same child as in the previous notebook..</dc:description>

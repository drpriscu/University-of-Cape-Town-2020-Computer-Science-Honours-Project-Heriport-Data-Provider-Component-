  <dc:description>A fable, somewhat similar to the Hottentot one of the lion and the jackal who went to shoot elands ('Reynard the Fox in South Africa', p.3, etc.), was told in the Katkop dialect, by =kasin (L IV.-1. 3486-3515); from whose dictation another beginning of the same fable has also been written down (L IV.-1. 3485). A slightly different version, likewise given by =kasin, has only been hurriedly taken down in English (L IV.-1. 3484 rev.-3492 rev.). A fragment of the story about the Lion who takes away the Jackal's eland. 1) p.3484v: see Story of the Lion and the Jackals: another translation which is a little different and Story of the Lion and the Jackals, 2) This story is found in Book IV-1.</dc:description>

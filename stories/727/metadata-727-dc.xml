  <dc:description>An insert containing an address to an old woman in which she is asked where she grew up as a child and what the place's name is. It asks her who her friends (or companions) were, and what her people's names are. 1) This story is a loose insert found inside the back cover of Book VIII-15, along with some other pages containing untranslated |xam text and a scrap of paper on which the Latin name of the Blue crane is written (Tetrapteryx paradisea), 2) See also Thy name which is a Bushman name, what is it?'

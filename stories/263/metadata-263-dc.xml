  <dc:description>The Jackal and the Hyena' (in which piece there are interminable speeches by the Jackal) contains many allusions to other fables, and really forms part of the lengthy discourse of the Dawns-Heart (L II.-19. 1710-1759, 20. 1760-1855, 21. 1856-1948). The doings of jackals: they steal game from beasts of prey and get killed by them as a result. They are clever and follow scents, drive springbok and bring down a springbok as a pack, but they are also cowards, and cannot hunt or catch flesh on their own. They foolishly fight among themselves instead of eating their prey and the hyena takes it away from them. The verso pages contain additional information about how jackals eat (after they have eaten their fill they bite off pieces of flesh and hold them in their mouths, then scratch a hole in which to bury it) and their hunting strategy (some jackals approach the prey from the front and one from behind). 1) Date on p.1720: 27 July; p.1743: 6 August, 2) p.1710v: |a!kunta adds a note suggesting that the jackal hunts badly (slecht) on his own, 3) p.1711v: ||kabbo says that the jackal is clever (and uses the Dutch words schelm and slimm), 4) p.1758v: Lloyd: 'J.T [||kabbo] tells me that the Day Heart star story is at an end, and that he is now telling me a story of jackals , which !kaun !khe's the previous (Day H.) one. But the last time I wrote, he told me that the Day H. story still continued', 5) See also The Jackal's speech or The Jackals and a springbok which the Hyena takes away from them and The Day's Heart star, 6) This story is found in Book II-19.</dc:description>

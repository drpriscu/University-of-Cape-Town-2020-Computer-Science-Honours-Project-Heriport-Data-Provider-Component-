  <dc:description>The Vultures, their elder sister (who was a girl of the early race), and her husband. By/|han=kasso (LVIII.-27. 8351-8373). The Vultures make a woman (of the Early Race) their elder sister and live with her at her house. The elder sister's husband (a man of the Early Race) scolds the Vultures for devouring all the food, and the next day his wife goes with him to the hunting-ground, where she must eat (as his sisters-in-law eat everything at home). The Vultures look for food and see a springbok lying on the ground. They eat the dead springbok, looking around them (for the husband) as they do so, and leave meat for their elder sister, who approaches. 1) p.8351opp: |han=kass'o heard this from his mother (|xabbi-an), 2) p.8352v: the Vultures probably used their hands to take the skin, as they are people, 3) This story is found in Book VIII-27.</dc:description>

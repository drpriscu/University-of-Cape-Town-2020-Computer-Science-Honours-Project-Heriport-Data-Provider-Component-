  <dc:description>The Moon is created from a long white wing-feather of the Ostrich. After |kaggen (the Mantis) breaks the eland's gall and it blinds him, he crawls, feeling his way to the place of the Ostrich, where he finds a feather. He throws it into the sky so that it may become the Moon and light the ground for him to see in the darkness.</dc:description>

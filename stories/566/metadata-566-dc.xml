  <dc:description>The Old Man, the Little Hare, and the Lions. Related by ≠giri–sse (L VII.-1. 6032-6040, partly translated). A fragment of the above story was also related by ≠giri–sse (L VII.-1. 6031). Explanatory note in the Katkop dialect, by Díä!kwãin (L VII.-1. 6031 rev. and 6032 rev.). The old man tells the Hare to tell the people who travel past his house to travel below the mountain, because he cannot escape on his leg. The Lions come near the old man's house because they are hungry and the old man tells the Lions to catch and eat the Hare, which runs away. The old man cuts off his bad leg and calls for mist (|kumm) to come to the 'killing place' as he hops away from the Lions. 1) This story starts on p.6031 with a fragment of the account and picks up again on p.6032, 2) ≠girri-sse is also spelt ≠giri-sse and ≠gerri-sse, 3) p.6031 opp: this story was told to ≠gerri-sse by his mother (!kwarra-an, see also The story of a sorceress; that which she did when the Kafir had hurt my throat, she 'snored' me, when my throat was swollen), 4) p.6031v: genealogical information about |han≠kass'o ; included are the names of some of his relations, 5) The explanatory notes for this story were given by Dia!kwain, 6) p.6039v: the name of the mist in the song is |kumm (according to both ≠gerri-sse and Dia!kwain), 7) See also The old man's song, 8) This story is found in Book VII-1.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Springbok will lead people to a lion. Their knowledge of distant things gained by their fine scent. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain, from his parents (L V.-9. 4619-4651). Also, game knows the time of men's deaths, and as such their behaviour must be observed. The springbok tells people things if they understand its actions.</dc:description>

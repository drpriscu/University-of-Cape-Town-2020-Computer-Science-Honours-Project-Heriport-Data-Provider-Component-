  <dc:description>The Sho-|oa in general use is not found upon the flats, but in the mountains near the Orange River, and in the mountains and rivers, generally speaking, throughout the country. When dug out by the Bushmen, they replant a part of it with a small piece of the root attached; and take other roots in an old bag, hanging them up to dry opposite the house, etc. (L II.-36. 3269-3278). More about Ssho |oa, including where it is found, how it is collected and dried, and its use in hunting. A Ssho |oa band is worn when hunting. The smell of Ssho |oa on the hunter's bodies makes the game act foolishly. 1) Note on the inside of the cover of Book II-36: pp.3242-3332 were translated in September 1873, but Lloyd 'Began to enter from p.3261 Aug. 1st 1911.', 2) p.3269v: different types of Ssho |oa, 3) p.3270v: the Haak Boom (or Rake tree), so called because its thorns resemble the curved teeth of a rake, 4) See also Ssho |oa and How women fear the new Ssho |oa which has just been brought home and An ignorant man digs up Ssho |oa and the consequences of his actions and The consequences of a woman's smelling fresh Ssho |oa scent and What the man does and says to the new Ssho |oa so that it may know him, 5) This story is found in Book II-36.</dc:description>

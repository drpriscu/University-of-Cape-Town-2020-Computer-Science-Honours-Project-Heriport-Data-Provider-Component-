  <dc:description>The power over ostriches possessed by /uherre (maternal uncle of Dia!kwain). This is followed by a long discourse concerning successful and unsuccessful hunting, as well as by a prayer, addressed by the mother of the narrator to the dead, that her husbands hunting might prove more fortunate. The result of this prayer is described. Allusion is also made to the belief that unsuccessful hunting may forebode danger to the hunter. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (L V.-10. 4778-4795-4868). Dia!kwain's uncle |uherre had in the past asked his spirit ancestors to give the people bad luck with the game because they had abused him. A man says that |uherre made an ostrich come to him, but complains that it is a lean bird. An old woman warns him that magicians first send lean, old and ugly things to test them. The people must eat the lean ostrich, after which fat ones will be sent to them. Dia!kwain's mother (and other women) beat the digging stone on the ground to pray to the spirit-people. The story moves on to a more general narrative about game-sorcerers and spirit-people.</dc:description>

<title>More about |xue</title>
<summary>In this story |xue becomes an ant,  a butterfly, a fly, water, a buffalo, a snake, a tsan, a ||xuonna and a bird. |xue chases his wife in a variety of forms and eventually dies. His wife picks him up and puts him inside her kaross, but drops him when he becomes a ||xuonna. She goes on into her father&apos;s country. In another part of the account (also told to !nanni by Karu) |xue also becomes !naxane, an owl, a fly, a bee, a hyena and, finally, an ant. As a bee he bites and kills his father. |xue performs a doctoring ceremony and his father rises up and chases |xue. |xue and his father fight. Eventually, |xue settles on his father&apos;s head and he dies. |xue&apos;s father takes him off his head and sets |xue down on the ground, where he becomes an ant.</summary><comments>1) p.9391v: !nanni heard this story from his paternal grandfather (Karu); see |xue and the ostriches, 2) p.9401v: (17 March 1880) the name for |uma and Da&apos;s father (||ko |kue); |uma and Da&apos;s country is called ||noma; see <i>The doings of |xue are many</i>, 3) p.9402v: the name of a poison (<i>!kara</i>) and the name of the tree whose leaves are boiled to make a poison in combination with another ingredient, 4) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-5</comments><date>17 March 1880 (started)</date><storypages>9395-9403</storypages><category>Transformation</category><category>Healing and ailing</category><author>!nanni (XI)</author><keyword><kw>|xue</kw><subkw>more about |xue</subkw></keyword>

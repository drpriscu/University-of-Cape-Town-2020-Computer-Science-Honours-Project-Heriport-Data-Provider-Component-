  <dc:description>Kai Tamme and !nanni name and describe poisons used by the !kun, most of them taken from trees and plants. There are many poisons. The poisons are prepared (often boiled in a pot) and put onto arrows to shoot game. The people also gather caterpillars called  from large trees, with which they make poison. !nanni describes one of these excursions to gather this poison by his people. His father and grandfather (Karu) were on this excursion, and Karu was injured during the outing.</dc:description>

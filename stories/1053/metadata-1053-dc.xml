  <dc:description>Tamme and !nanni name and describe poisons used by the !kun, most of them taken from trees and plants. There are many poisons. The poisons are prepared (often boiled in a pot) and put onto arrows to shoot game. The people also gather caterpillars called Kai from large trees, with which they make poison. !nanni describes one of these excursions to gather this poison by his people. His father and grandfather (Karu) were on this excursion, and Karu was injured during the outing. 1) p.9581opp: Tamme heard this (on the opposite page) from his father (||namme) and observed it himself, 2) p.9582v: a note on how certain animals sleep: the hyena sleeps soundly but with its ears and the jackal sleeps with its eyes but not its ears, 3) p.9583v: Tamme says that people become intoxicated when they eat a cat's flesh, 4) The term of address for a young male child, 5) What the !kun call each other and their in-laws by way of showing respect (=khumm). They refrain from saying people's names (little or great). Men appear to respect women (including their daughters) and vice versa, 6) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-8.</dc:description>

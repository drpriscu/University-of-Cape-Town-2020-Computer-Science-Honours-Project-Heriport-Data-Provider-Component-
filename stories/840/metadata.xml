<title>The !gwiten who was niggardly to his wife</title>
<summary>The Wild Dog (or <i>!gwiten</i>) is stingy (&apos;niggardly&apos;) to his wife (when they were people of the Early Race). He gives his wife the lean male pig, but takes the fat sow for himself, and she becomes thinner and thinner. She makes soup for her brothers, using the lean meat and not the fat. The Wild Dog tells his wife she must cook the sow&apos;s meat for them, because her brothers are not used to eating what she is making for them. The wife refuses. </summary><comments>1) p.8215v: |han≠kass&apos;o heard this story from his maternal grandmother (≠kammi), 2) p.8230v: see <i>The !k&apos;anni is an ornament worn by men and women</i>, 3) This story is found in Book VIII-25</comments><date>7 February 1879 (story given on or about)</date><storypages>8216-8231</storypages><category>History (Early Race)</category><author>|han≠kass'o (Klein Jantje) (VIII)</author><keyword><kw>Wild Dog</kw><subkw>feared his brother-in-law&apos;s anger at his stinginess</subkw></keyword>

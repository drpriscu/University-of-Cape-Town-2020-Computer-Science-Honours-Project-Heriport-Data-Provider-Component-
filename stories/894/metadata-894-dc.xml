  <dc:description>The Quagga, who was poisoned by her husband, !kuinssi/kauoken. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-29. 8603-8614, 30. 8615-8627). The Tortoise takes a piece of liver away from the baby Quagga and shares it with other animals, who agree that it tastes so good that it must be Quagga liver. They tell the young He-Dog that he must have married game and that he must kill her so that they can eat her. One of the Quagga children lets her tears fall into the cooking pots, which break. The young He-Dog marries another Quagga and the Quagga's parents hold a dance and trample the young He-Dog to death.</dc:description>

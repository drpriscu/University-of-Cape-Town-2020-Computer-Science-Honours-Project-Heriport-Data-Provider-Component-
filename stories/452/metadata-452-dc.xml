  <dc:description>The Maiden who would not listen to her parents, and was punished, together with those around her, by the angry Rain. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (L V.-13. 4981-5022). A story about the Early Race (the !khwe ||na ss'e !k'e) and the Rain, when the Porcupine was a man and how it came by the quills on its back and neck. The Porcupine's sister is a new maiden and behaves disobediently, and the Rain becomes angry and kills with lightning because it feels the girl does not protect the people. The brother must address the angry Rain in an effort to direct it to a different place. The new maiden is caught in a storm, even though she had been told not to go out. She is taken up by a whirlwind and becomes a snake.</dc:description>

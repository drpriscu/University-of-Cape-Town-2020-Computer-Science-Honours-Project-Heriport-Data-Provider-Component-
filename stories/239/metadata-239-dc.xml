  <dc:description>Among the fights which the Mantis has with different personages and animals, one of the most interesting to the Bushman mind, is that with a being whose eyes are in his feet, instead of his head, which is smooth. Its unusual name is !goe!kweitentu, but it has others, one of which seems identical with the Bushman name for the Ignis fatuus . This personage, in the first instance, gives the Mantis a severe beating, but the latter, obtaining advice from his grandson, the Ichneumon, with regard to the proper method of attacking this foe, is ultimately victorious. Of this myth we have three versions; a short one (L II.-9. 935-966), a long one (B II.391-420, III. 461-500, XI.1027-1119, XII. 1121-1170, XIX.1805-1871, XX. 1872-1964, again pp.1805-1816, 1872-1910, 2060-2152), and a third, in the Katkop dialect from Dia!kwain, related to him by his mother =kamme-an, which is a continuation of his version of the Mantis and his pet eland (L V.-1. 3683-3700, V.-2. 3793-3861)</dc:description>

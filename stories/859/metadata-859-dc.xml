  <dc:description>Signs made by Bushmen in order to show the direction in which they have gone. By /han=kasso.(L VIII.-27. 8374-8386). If a member of the group goes off and does not return in time, the others make marks (acting as pointers) in the earth by pushing their feet along the ground, and if they are travelling away they place grass near these marks. In a second part of the account, |han=kass'o decribes the manner in which branches are 'reversed' and arranged upside down (green tops in the ground) in a certain manner pointing to where the people have gone. 1) Date on p.8382: 17 April (2nd part of story), 2) p.8373v: |han=kass'o heard this from his mother (|xabbi-an) and observed it himself, 3) p.8375v: on the arrangement of the pieces of grass that point to where the people have gone, 4) p.8379v: getting lost: what white men and the |xam say, 5) p.8381v: |han=kass'o saw his grandfather reverse branches in this way, 6) p.8382v: the placement of the branches, 7) This story is found in Book VIII-27.</dc:description>

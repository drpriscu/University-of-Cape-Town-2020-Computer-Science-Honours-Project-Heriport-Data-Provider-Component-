  <dc:description>The Sun, a man from whose armpit brightness proceeded, lived formerly on earth; but only gave light for a space around his house. Some children belonging to the First Bushmen (who preceded the Flat Bushmen in their country) were therefore sent to throw up the sleeping Sun into the sky; since then, he shines all over the earth. We have two complete versions of this myth,a short one (L II.-4. 487 and 488, 488a-k, 494-499,), and a longer one (LII.-35. 3150-3159, 3165-3236 rev.)</dc:description>

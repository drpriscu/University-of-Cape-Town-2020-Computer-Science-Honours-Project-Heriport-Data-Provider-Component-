  <dc:description>The Rain believed to be ridden by sorcerers. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-27. 8399 rev. and 8400 rev., note). When the Rain is angry with anyone, people may be carried off in the whirlwind, and various transformations effected. The young women should propitiate a water pit, by means of 'buchu' and tto. (L VIII.-16. 7418-7428.) The old people say that when the rain is angry it wants to kill people. It takes the man who made it angry, and all his people, and turns them into frogs at the pond. Their karosses and quiver skins become springboks and their sticks become bushes.</dc:description>

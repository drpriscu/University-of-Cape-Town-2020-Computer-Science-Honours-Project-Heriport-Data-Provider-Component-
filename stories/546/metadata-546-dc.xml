  <dc:description>Certain cuts to be made upon the bow, when a Baboon has been killed. A similar ceremony to be observed with regard to the Hyena. A Baboon, when killed, resembles a man, in 'making cloud'. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (L V.-24. 5911-5916, 5911 rev., note). When a hyena has been killed, the bow is also cut with lines (as with killing a baboon) to remove the hyena's curse from the bow. This is so that the hyena's 'actions' will not be on the bow. 1) See also Cuts to be made on a bow when a baboon has been killed, 2) This story is found in Book V-24.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A fable, somewhat similar to the Hottentot one of the lion and the jackal who went to shoot elands ('Reynard the Fox in South Africa', p.3, etc.), was told in the Katkop dialect, by  k sin (L IV.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>1. 3486</dc:description>
  <dc:description>3515); from whose dictation another beginning of the same fable has also been written down (L IV.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>1. 3485). A slightly different version, likewise given by  k sin, has only been hurriedly taken down in English (L IV.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>1. 3484 rev.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>3492 rev.). A Jackal shoots an eland on two days running, and on both occasions the Lion takes it away from him. The sorceress advises him to remain silent and stay at home and she makes all the bushes and water vanish so that an eland comes up to the house. The Jackal shoots the eland and the sorceress makes a mountain rise up with the eland dead upon it. The Lion wants jackal fat poured into his mouth and the Jackal drops a hot stone into the Lion's mouth below. His insides are burned up and he dies while running away.</dc:description>

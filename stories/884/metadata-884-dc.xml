  <dc:description>The two brothers, of the Early Race, who collected ostrich eggs, and were chased by Koranna-Hottentots. By /han=kasso (L VIII.28. 8486-8506). A story of the Early Race about a man called !kotta-kkoe who always swallows the ostrich eggs he finds, instead of putting them away. !kotta-kkoe's younger brother is more sensible and puts away the eggs in his bag. They run away from some Korannas, but !kotta-kkoe's stomach tears open from the weight of the eggs and his entrails fall into the river. !kotta-kkoe calls out to the Korannas to stop trying to kill him, as he is already dying from the huge hole in his stomach. The Korannas go after the younger brother and !kotta-kkoe draws together the edges of his stomach with a Driedoorn branch and escapes with his brother.</dc:description>

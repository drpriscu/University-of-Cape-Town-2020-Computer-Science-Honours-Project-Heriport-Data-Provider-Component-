  <dc:description>...the Moon’s mother, who, according to the first version (begun by ≠kásin, but mainly related by Dia!kwãin), died in consequence of the wrong message delivered to men by the Hare; whereupon the angered Moon split the Hare’s mouth with a stick. (L IV.–4. 3882–3885.)  A story about the origin of death in which the Moon beats the Hare for changing the Moon's story around and not telling it properly. 1) There are three versions of this story in this notebook (IV-4); see also Story of the Moon and the Hare: a version by Dia!kwain and Story of the Moon and the Hare: a version by ≠kasin, 2) p.3882 opp: the first page of this story is told by ≠kasin, who heard it from his mother (kwa ≠ko): it is told from the Moon's point of view, 3) p.3882v: Dia!kwain takes over the telling of this story from the opposite page (p.3883); he heard it from his mother (≠kamme-an), 4) This story is found in Book IV-4.</dc:description>

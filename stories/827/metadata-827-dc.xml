  <dc:description>The coming of an owl is considered as a sign of the approach of a Lion. An insult offered by a little child, to a fly, is reported by the latter to the Lion, as disrespect shown to himself. This, the Lion waits to avenge, until the child is older. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-23. 8058 rev., 8060 rev., 8078-8080). |han=kass'o's grandfather (Tsatsi) told him that an owl comes to the people when a lion is about to come to try and catch them. Also, children should not exclaim or breathe out through their nostrils in a certain manner if a fly ('lion's fly') is nearby, because it would tell the lion that a child had made light of the lion.</dc:description>

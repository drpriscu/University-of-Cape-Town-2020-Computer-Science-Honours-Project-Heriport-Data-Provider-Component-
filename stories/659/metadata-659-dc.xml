  <dc:description>The Mantis and Kóro–tuíten. The Mantis learns from Kóro–tuíten how to obtain 'Bushman–rice' (i.e. larvae of the ants) with ease; but, acting ungratefully towards his instructor, he soon loses his newly acquired power. By /han≠kass’o (L VIII.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>6939). A note states that Kóro–tuíten was formerly a man of the early race (L VIII.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>10. 6885 rev.). 'Bushman rice' may be dug by both men and women. By /han≠kass’o (L VIII.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>10. 6888 rev., note). |kaggen (the Mantis) is out hunting when he comes across Koro</dc:description>
  <dc:description>tuiten, who flies down into a 'Bushman</dc:description>
  <dc:description>rice' hole and carries out a kaross full of 'Bushman</dc:description>
  <dc:description>rice' (ant larvae). |kaggen asks Koro</dc:description>
  <dc:description>tuiten to anoint him with its perspiration so he too can get lots of 'Bushman</dc:description>
  <dc:description>rice'. |kaggen breaks all his things (including his digging</dc:description>
  <dc:description>stick), but gets a kaross full of 'Bushman rice'. He returns home and goes out to meet Koro</dc:description>
  <dc:description>tuiten again, and fills many karosses of 'Bushman</dc:description>
  <dc:description>rice'. Koro</dc:description>
  <dc:description>tuiten asks him to divide his 'Bushman</dc:description>
  <dc:description>rice', but |kaggen refuses. The next day when he tries to dive into the earth he crushes his brow, because the earth is now hard.</dc:description>

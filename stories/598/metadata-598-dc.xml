The latter is held in the hand of the performer, and the blade of wood (attached to the string) is then, by means of the stick-handle, whirled about in the air, producing a strong whirring sound. When several of these instruments are used at a time, a considerable effect must be produced), followed by the account of a Bushman dance, in which the men dance, one woman beats the drum, and the rest of the women sit, clapping their hands for the dancers.

  <dc:description>The employment of the !gõin–!gõin (the !gõin–!gõin consists of a [variously–sized] blade of wood, attached by a little cord to a short stick. The latter is held in the hand of the performer, and the blade of wood (attached to the string) is then, by means of the stick–handle, whirled about in the air, producing a strong whirring sound. When several of these instruments are used at a time, a considerable effect must be produced), followed by the account of a Bushman dance, in which the men dance, one woman beats the drum, and the rest of the women sit, clapping their hands for the dancers. By /han≠kass’o (L VIII.-1. 6108-6127). The !goin-!goin (or 'bullroarer') is beaten to attract an abundance of bees and provide honey for the people to eat. 1) See also The preparation of the drum; ears of springbok are tied to the feet of the men who dance and The preparation of the springbok's ears and How the prepared springbok's ears are tied on, 2) This story is found in Book VIII-1.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A story about Rainmaking and the work of Rainmakers. Dia!kwain's mother tells him that to make rain fall and food grow the Rain</dc:description>
  <dc:description>bull must be led by the thong over to the Rainmakers' place where they might kill it and cut up its flesh to ensure that Rain might fall. Where the bull is killed is where the Rain will fall and the plants grow. The people ask the Rainmakers to make Rain or else they will die of starvation and the Rainmakers promise that they will do so. The falling of Rain ensures that the mothers may dig for their food and feed their children. The Rainmakers ('medicine men') warn the people that rain will not fall if it is angry or if the people have not behaved well or not taken good care of their Rainmakers.

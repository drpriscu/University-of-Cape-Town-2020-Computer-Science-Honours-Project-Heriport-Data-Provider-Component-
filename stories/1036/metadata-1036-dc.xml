  <dc:description>|xue is water, a lizard, grass, a |nu-erre bird, a dead elephant, a buffalo, a tsan, an Omuherero and a snake (a ||ge). |xue makes reeds at the water and grabs one of the woodpigeons. |xue becomes |xue and rises up and grabs the bitten woodpigeon and plucks out its feathers, putting them on his head. |xue puts the woodpigeon's body on hot embers and eats it. He hears an Ovaherero and hides. |xue flies away to his mother's country where he sees his father. |xue's mother and father become afraid of him and run away. |xue chases his father, all the while loudly speaking the Berg Damara language. |xue fears the large black reeds where his father hides. |xue sits and drinks water from a little hole and cries for his father. His father sees him, but leaves because |xue is an Omuherero. |xue searches for his father and cries when he does not find him.</dc:description>

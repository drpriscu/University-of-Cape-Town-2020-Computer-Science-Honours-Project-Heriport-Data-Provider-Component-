  <dc:description>The Moon is not to be looked at, when game has been shot, for fear of evil consequences. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (LV.-21. 5643-5654). Hunters lower their heads and do not look up when they have shot game, because the Moon's 'water' would cause the game to live (the Moon's water is what the people observe lying on bushes, which resembles 'liquid honey').</dc:description>

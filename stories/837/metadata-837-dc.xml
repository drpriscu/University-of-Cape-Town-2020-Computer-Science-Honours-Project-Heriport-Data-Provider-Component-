  <dc:description>The Man of the Early Race, whose head was of stone, the Lioness, and the Children. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-25. 8177-8197). A Lioness gathers together many of the people's children because she is an invalid and needs them to work for her. Ddi xerreten (a man of the Early Race who has a stone head) goes to her house and points out to the children the fires of their own people in different ravines, until they have all gone home.When the Lioness arrives at her house she asks Ddi xerreten where her children are and he says that they are not her children. The Lioness hurts her jaw on his stone head and is left sitting angrily at her house.</dc:description>

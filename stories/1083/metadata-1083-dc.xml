  <dc:description>A story about stars and some of their doings. The star has small arms and no horns. It is a small thing. When the 'darkness sits' or night falls, the star runs off into the sky. The children pull the star from the earth and play with the star. The children take it up and then throw it away. In this way the children kill the star. When stars fall to earth they die.</dc:description>

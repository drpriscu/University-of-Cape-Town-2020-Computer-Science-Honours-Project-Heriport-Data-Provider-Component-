  <dc:description>A story about stars and some of their doings. The star has small arms and no horns. It is a small thing. When the 'darkness sits' or night falls, the star runs off into the sky. The children pull the star from the earth and play with the star. The children take it up and then throw it away. In this way the children kill the star. When stars fall to earth they die. 1) p.9867v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu) and observed it himself, 2) p.9868v: (12 September 1881) terms for thunder and lightning; the name for 'real water' which is what lies on the earth; water in the sky is not called 'water', but 'cloud' - when it rains this water is called 'water' but when it does not, the water in the sky is 'cloud', 3) Part of the story was told by Tamme, who heard it from his father (||namme), 4) p.9873v: (Tamme, 7 July 1881) referring to the picture of same date of the =keku fruit which is like fat and is 'worked' by girls who rub themselves with it (see Iziko_SAMLB_TaBook3_011), 5) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-11.</dc:description>

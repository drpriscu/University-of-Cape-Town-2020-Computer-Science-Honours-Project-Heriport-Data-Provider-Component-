  <dc:description>8176). The Lioness (in the times of the Early Race) decides to keep a baby girl that she finds and names it Biting</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Torn</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Away (or Tssi</dc:description>
  <dc:description>!kuarra |hin), and she grows up. The Lioness tricks a child into sending her brother to her at night, but his grandmothers, !kwa</dc:description>
  <dc:description>!kwa and !kwa</dc:description>
  <dc:description>kau, are also there (they are people and also trees). The Lioness tries to find a way of catching the young man on his own, but Biting</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Torn</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Away protects him and warns him how to behave around her mother. Whenever the Lioness tells a lie when she is near the fire, !kwa</dc:description>
  <dc:description>!kau and !kwa</dc:description>
  <dc:description>!kwa crackle from within it, causing her to move away. The Lioness kills a gemsbok and Biting</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Torn</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Away and the young man go to help her. The Lioness places some of the meat into a thong that she twists around her body, and asks Biting</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Torn</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Away to help lift her up. While Biting</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Torn</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Away lifts her mother's arms, the husband stabs her exposed flesh with his knife. The young man returns to his own mother's house, bringing Biting</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Torn</dc:description>
  <dc:description>Away with him.</dc:description>

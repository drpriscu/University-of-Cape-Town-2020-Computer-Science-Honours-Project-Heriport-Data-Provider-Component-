  <dc:description>The Bushman Doctor or Sorcerer (L II.-1. 273-275). An account of these people was also given in the Katkop dialect by Dia!kwain (L V.-3. 4122-4131). The people catch the man who beats (or trembles) and bites with his teeth, hold him down and rub fat onto his back to take off the lion hair that grows there. Once this has been done the man is comfortable and sits talking. 1) Note on the inside of the back cover of this notebook: 'Finished correcting Sept 15/71 from Jantje Toorm himself', 2) See also About sorcerers: when the sorcerer returns home after his work is done, 3) This story is found in Book II-1.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>This is a story about |xue and his wives (!nanni says that he saw |xue, his  house and child while !nanni was with the Herero). |xue resembles a lizard one day, a |ou (a small buck, probably a steenbok) the next, and a little tsema and a ||ha and a python (â‰ ni), all on different days. When |xue dies he resembles the |ou (and has horns). As |xue lies there dead his wives see him and come and pick him up and carry him to the house. The elder (or 'greater') wife makes a fire to cook the kid, and puts his body on the fire. |xue calls out, objecting to being put on the fire. The second wife takes |xue to her house and covers him with a kaross. He bites it and becomes a kid again. The second wife kills him and puts him in a cooking pot, shutting him in and covering him. He becomes an ant and bites his second wife. His wife crushes his ant's head and throws |xue down on the ground.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Son of the Wind. By |han=kasso (L VIII.-8. 6687-6708). |na ka ti's mother tells him not to say the name of the son of the Wind until his father has made a hut for them. When the father is finished, |na ka ti calls the Wind's name and then runs to the hut. The Wind blows away the people's houses, except for the Wind's hut. The Wind's mother picks up the son of the Wind and it stops blowing. A strong shelter must be made before calling the Wind's name.</dc:description>

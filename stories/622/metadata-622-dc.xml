  <dc:description>The Rhinoceros and her daughters suitors. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-5. 6456-6504). The She-Rhinoceros has two daughters. The youngest is Driving Away (Ssuai-ssuai-||a-|uhan), who asks her mother for food as a reward for telling her (by means of a song) when people come to court her elder daughter (!kwa !khe). The She-Rhinoceros chases them away with her short horn, and the !gwiten (Silver Fox) throws a stick at them as they run away, complaining about the dust that has been kicked up. The Leopard goes to !kwa-!khe and the younger sister starts her singing again. The elder sister asks her to stop, but Driving Away still wants the reward of food from the She-Rhinoceros and sings about the new suitor. The mother instructs her to fetch the long horn, because it is the Leopard and he will not be afraid of her. !kwa-!khe beats her mother on the back with a stick and leaves with the Leopard. The cowardly suitors (the Jackals and Hyena) see the Leopard bringing !kwa-!khe as his wife and discuss how they would have married her had her mother not fought them. 1) Note by Lloyd on the inside of the front cover of Book VIII-5 reads: 'Finished translating 'The She-Rhinoceros and her Elder Daughter's Suitors' 16th and 17th January, 1901.', 2) This story was told to |han=kass'o by his mother (|xabbi-an),  3) p.6463v: the song sung by Driving Away was 'Be flying quickly', 4) See also The song of the Mother Rhinoceros, 5) This story is found in book VIII-5.</dc:description>

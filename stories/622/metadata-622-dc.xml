  <dc:description>The Rhinoceros and her daughters suitors. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-5. 6456-6504). The She-Rhinoceros has two daughters. The youngest is Driving Away (Ssuai-ssuai-||a-|uhan), who asks her mother for food as a reward for telling her (by means of a song) when people come to court her elder daughter (!kwa !khe). The She-Rhinoceros chases them away with her short horn, and the !gwiten (Silver Fox) throws a stick at them as they run away, complaining about the dust that has been kicked up. The Leopard goes to !kwa-!khe and the younger sister starts her singing again. The elder sister asks her to stop, but Driving Away still wants the reward of food from the She-Rhinoceros and sings about the new suitor. The mother instructs her to fetch the long horn, because it is the Leopard and he will not be afraid of her. !kwa-!khe beats her mother on the back with a stick and leaves with the Leopard. The cowardly suitors (the Jackals and Hyena) see the Leopard bringing !kwa-!khe as his wife and discuss how they would have married her had her mother not fought them.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Very little of this story has been translated. 'the living things which move about in the world. all came out of one hole': Kafirs, Englishmen, !koranna, Boers, Bastards, Orlams, Bushmen all 'passed out' (through the hole, presumably). The rest is harder to piece together. 1) Piet Lynx heard this story from his father, 2) p.84 opp: Piet says that there are two kinds of Bastards: those with smooth hair and those with short hair, 3) This story is found in Kora Book I-1.</dc:description>

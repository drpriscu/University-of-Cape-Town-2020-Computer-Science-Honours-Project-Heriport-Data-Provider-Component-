<title>A note on the First Bushmen </title>
<summary>A series of three notes about the first people (the First Bushmen). In the first their children worked to raise the Sun; in the second they teach their children the histories of the first people; the third tells of the time before the Sun was thrown into the sky and his light shone only around his house.</summary><comments>1) An explanatory note on the contents page of this book reads: &apos;He (the sun) (J.T tells me) was a man, who only gave forth brightness for a space around his own house. His shining did not reach other places. He, before this action of the children&apos;s, had not been in the sky, but had lived at his own house, on earth. He was not a !khwe |na ssho !kui.&apos;, 2) See also <i>The children of the First Bushmen (who preceded the Flat Bushmen in their country) throw up the sleeping Sun into the sky</i>, 3) This story is found in Book II-35</comments><date>September 1873</date><storypages>3150opp, 3150v</storypages><category>History (Early Race)</category><category>Celestial bodies and aeroscopy</category><author>||kabbo (Jantje) (II)</author><keyword><kw>Early Race</kw><subkw>a note on the First Bushmen</subkw></keyword>

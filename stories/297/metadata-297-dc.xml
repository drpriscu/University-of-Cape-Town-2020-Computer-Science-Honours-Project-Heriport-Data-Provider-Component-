  <dc:description>A series of three notes about the first people (the First Bushmen). In the first their children worked to raise the Sun; in the second they teach their children the histories of the first people; the third tells of the time before the Sun was thrown into the sky and his light shone only around his house. 1) An explanatory note on the contents page of this book reads: 'He (the sun) (J.T tells me) was a man, who only gave forth brightness for a space around his own house. His shining did not reach other places. He, before this action of the children's, had not been in the sky, but had lived at his own house, on earth. He was not a !khwe |na ssho !kui.', 2) See also The children of the First Bushmen (who preceded the Flat Bushmen in their country) throw up the sleeping Sun into the sky, 3) This story is found in Book II-35.</dc:description>

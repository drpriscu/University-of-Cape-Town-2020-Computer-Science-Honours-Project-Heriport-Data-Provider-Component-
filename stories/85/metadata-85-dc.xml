  <dc:description>The Blue Crane goes along singing that the Krieboom berries are on her shoulder. There are verses for walking slowly, for running away from a man and for flapping her wings. These are also verses about a white stone splinter (for scraping skins). 1) p.2154v: !kann, a stone pipe made by 'Hottentots' out of serpentine or similar stone; a !xoro pipe; a note on a bird that was formerly a man; this song is sung by men and women; note on krieboom berries (|gara), their appearance, what they taste like and who eats them (|xam and Korannas), 2) p.2155v: a note on the name of the berries; ||kabbo can't explain why the berries do not roll off; the story is one that tells of the 'very old people', the 'first old people', and it lies 'in his thoughts'; |xam and Koranna women pick and place berries in a bag, then mix them with others in order to keep their teeth strong for chewing other foods, 3) p.2156v: about a stone splinter; the bird sings of its head which is said to resemble the shape of the stone knife or splinter; the |xam cut up game with such a stone knife, and a note on its making; Grass Bushmen make arrowheads of quartz; a few verses on the scraping of springbok skins for the making of bedding, and goat skin as well; the Blue Crane (Anthropoides stanleyanus) was formerly a person of the Early Race, 4) This story is found in Book XXIII.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A leopard jumps out of a bush and grasps a man's head in its claws. The man slowly returns to his house to lie down and nurse his wounded head. In what seems to be the same story a lion jumps out at a man and bites him, killing him. The lion places the man's body in the shade of a tree.</dc:description>

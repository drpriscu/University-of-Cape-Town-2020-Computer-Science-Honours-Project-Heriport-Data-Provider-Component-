<summary><i>In former times, when animals were people, the Baboons were jealous of a young Quagga woman, who lived with them, on account of the notice attracted by her great size. For this reason, as well as for her fatness, they killed her, telling the other people that her flesh was that of a young gemsbok. In Katkop dialect, by Díä!kwãin, who had it from his father Xaättin (L V.-25. 5993-5997). The Punishment of the Baboon, which appears to be a continuation of the above fable, was narrated to Díä!kwãin by an older female relation named Ttuobboken !káugn (L V.-24. 5974-5991). An explanatory note to the story of the Punishment of the Baboon was also given by Díä!kwãin from information received from his mother, ≠kámme–an (L V.-24. 5992).</i> A story of the Early Race (or &apos;First Time&apos;) when all things were people.

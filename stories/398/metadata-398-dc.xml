  <dc:description>The Bushman Doctor or Sorcerer (L II.-1. 273-275). An account of these people was also given in the Katkop dialect by Dia!kwain (L V.-3. 4122-4131), from whom we besides have two reports of cures performed upon himself. The first of these (L V.-3. 4132-4161, 4. 4162-4199) includes a speech made by the sorceress; the second relates how she cured him when injured by a Kafir (L V.-4. 4200-4230). A note about the old sorceress !kwarra-an, where she lived and lives, her Dutch name (Mietje); how her husband =gerri-sse (or Jan Ronebout) and a son were shot by a Dutch man ('Boer') when out getting poison for their arrows. 1) The sorceress's son, =gerri-sse (also called =girri-sse and Jan Ronebout), was one of Lloyd's informants and Dia!kwain's companions, 2) See also The tale of a wise person or sorceress, what she said, when she talked with us and The story of a sorceress; that which she did when the Kafir had hurt my throat, she 'snored' me, when my throat was swollen and About sorcerers: when the sorcerer returns home after his work is done, 3) This story is found in Book V-3.</dc:description>

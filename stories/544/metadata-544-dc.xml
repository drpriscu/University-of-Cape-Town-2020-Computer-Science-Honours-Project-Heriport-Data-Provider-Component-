  <dc:description>Baboons not to be answered, when they address a Bushman in the early morning on his way to the hunting ground. They must, also, be alluded to in a very guarded manner, lest they should know that they are being spoken of. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (L V.-24. 5902-5910, 5905 rev. and 5906 rev., note). Baboons are not 'good people' and do not 'merely' want to sit and talk as people pass. The baboon gets angry and teases. It mocks and deceives people as they pass by. 1) p.5902 opp: this story was told to Dia!kwain by his father (Xaa-ttin), 2) pp.5905v &amp; 5906v: (8 February) on saying the baboon's name and its placing of its paw on its hipbone; methods of alluding to baboons without saying their name, 3) This story is found in Book V-24.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A note has been made, from //kábbo’s information, of a story not yet written down in Bushman, telling how the Rain carried off a girl belonging to the First Bushmen (or the ancient people living before the Bushmen), who afterwards became a frog, her kaross being changed into a springbok, etc. Her people were also transformed (L II.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>37. 3335 rev. and 3336 rev.). Versions of this transformation into frogs, ascribed chiefly to a New Maiden’s acts of disobedience, are given in the Katkop dialect by !kwéiten ta //kên (L VI.</dc:description>
  <dc:description>1. 3930</dc:description>
  <dc:description>3958), and by Dia!kwãin (B XXVII. 2609</dc:description>
  <dc:description>2618, continued in L V.</dc:description>

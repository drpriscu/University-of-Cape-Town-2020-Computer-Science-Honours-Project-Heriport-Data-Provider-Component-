  <dc:description>The |||hin is a snake found in !nanni's country which announces death if it lies on its back. If the snake turns over when struck, the people immediately leave it alone and return home. If the snake does not roll over when struck, the people kill and skin it and trade the skin with the Makoba. The snake appears when a person has died and the news has not yet reached other people. 1) p.9951v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu) and saw it himself, 2) See also A snake found near a grave and Snakes and spirits of the dead, 3) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-12.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>An account of rain-making by means of dragging a water-animal over the land, in illustration of a Bushman painting copied by Mr J.M. Orpen (Cape Monthly Magazine for July, 1874, frontispiece), was given, in the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain, who had it from his mother (BXXVII. 2540-2608). The beginning of this was repeated by him (L V.-3. 4075-4085), and two other accounts of rain-making were also given by him (L V.-3. 4086-4121). Rainmakers (!giten) lead out a waterbull and kill it on the place where it must rain (note on p.4077v: 'The water's bull's blood is water'. Its flesh and blood are thrown onto the places where the rain must fall); how the people should behave if they want the rain to fall. 1) p.4074v: Dia!kwain's parents told him about the colour of the waterbull's horns (black at the bottom and white at the top, as if scraped); the name of an onion-like plant, the root of which is eaten by people, 2) p.4077v: the waterbull's blood is water, 3) See also What happened when the thong (with which they were pulling at the Water's Bull) broke or Kko-kkoro's story and A rain story and Rainmaking: another story of it and Rainmaking, 4) This story is found in Book V-3.</dc:description>

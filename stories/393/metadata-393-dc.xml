  <dc:description>An account of rain-making by means of dragging a water-animal over the land, in illustration of a Bushman painting copied by Mr J.M. Orpen ( for July, 1874, frontispiece), was given, in the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain, who had it from his mother (BXXVII. 2540-2608). The beginning of this was repeated by him (L V.-3. 4075-4085), and two other accounts of rain-making were also given by him (L V.-3. 4086-4121). !giten</dc:description>

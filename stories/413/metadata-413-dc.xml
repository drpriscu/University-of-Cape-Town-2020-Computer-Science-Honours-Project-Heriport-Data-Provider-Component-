  <dc:description>Some Bushman children advised by their parents to be self-reliant in seeking food, in order to prepare themselves for the loss of their natural protectors. Related by Dia!kwain (L V.-6. 4404-4411 rev.-4413 rev.). This advice includes the waiting and watching for porcupine and other teachings relating to 'great things'. This is 'not a little story', but a 'great story', and is the story of the porcupine.</dc:description>

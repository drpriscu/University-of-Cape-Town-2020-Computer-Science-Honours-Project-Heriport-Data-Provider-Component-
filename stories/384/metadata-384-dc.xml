  <dc:description>Another legend relates how a man of this early race was killed and eaten by a lion; and it is used to point out the folly of venturing to fall asleep when out alone in the field. Told also by !kweiten ta //ken (L VI.-2. 4004-4025). By pretending to be dead the man escapes from the Lion, sneaking off home by a clever route in an effort to throw the Lion off his scent. The man hides under a pile of skins at home, but despite his people's efforts to protect him they give up and allow the Lion to take him. 1) p.4013v: this story was told to !kweiten ta ||ken by her mother (=kamme-an), 2) p.4015v: a note on the thorn trees and bushes found in this area (the Achterveld), 3) p.4023v: old men and women tell children that beasts of prey make people sleepy out in the veld, 4) See also The Lion and the man's story; what the Lion formerly did to the man or The young man of the Ancient Race, who was carried off by a Lion, when asleep in the field and A lion's story or The child who saved her sleeping parents from the lion, 5) This story is found in Book VI-2.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Another legend relates how a man of this early race was killed and eaten by a lion; and it is used to point out the folly of venturing to fall asleep when out alone in the field. Told also by !kweiten ta //ken (L VI.-2. 4004-4025). By pretending to be dead the man escapes from the Lion, sneaking off home by a clever route in an effort to throw the Lion off his scent. The man hides under a pile of skins at home, but despite his people's efforts to protect him they give up and allow the Lion to take him.</dc:description>

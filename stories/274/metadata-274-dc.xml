  <dc:description>The Rain-maker is asked to milk a nice female Rain which is gentle, the rain-clouds being her hair (L II.-24. 2213-2226, 25. 2227-2263). The verso pages of the account contain further notes as to the actions of the rain and the rainmaker, as well as mentioning the rain's legs (or rain-water) and ribs (or rain-clouds) and how the rainmaker rides the rain-cow.</dc:description>

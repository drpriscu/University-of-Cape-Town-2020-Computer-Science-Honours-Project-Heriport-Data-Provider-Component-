  <dc:description>The Frog, the Blue Crane, the Frogs husband, and the Beetle. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-32. 8812-8820). A tale of the Early Race in which the Frog (!ga) marries !kuommain |ka ||kau, but is embarrassed to relieve herself in front of him. Her body swells up and the Blue Crane makes a hole which the Frog vomits into. !kuommain |ka ||kau returns home and asks where the child is (his swollen wife had appeared as if pregnant). !kuommain |ka ||kau jumps up and runs away. 1) This is part 1 of the Blue Crane's story, 2) p.8811v: |han=kass'o heard this from his maternal grandmother (=kammi); he says it should precede the Blue Crane's story, 3) p.8814v: |han=kass'o's comments about the Beetle who resembles |kaggen, 4) See also How the Blue Crane vainly sought for !kuommain |ka ||kau, was killed and eaten by the Lions, and restored to life by means of one of the bones of the Mantis (Part 2) 5) This story is found in Book VIII-32.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>When the !kun hunt and kill an elephant they fear and respect its heart. One person alone cannot eat it and the hunter avoids eating it altogether. If the hunter were to eat the heart an elephant would kill him on another occasion.  The heart is shared out amongst the other people. It takes five days to eat an entire heart. The people cook elephant heart in a pot. 1) See also What !nanni's father told him (what to eat and avoid) and Food eaten by the !kun, 2) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-4.</dc:description>

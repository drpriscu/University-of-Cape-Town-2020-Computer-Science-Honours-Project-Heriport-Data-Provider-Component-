  <dc:description>Further details concerning what occurs at the death of a sorcerer, and concerning the harmful and beneficial doings of sorcerers (L V.-19. 5506-5530). When a sorcerer dies, an earthquake takes place, and a star shoots. Even when asleep, a sorcerer knows what is going about in the night; and takes care of the people, defending them from the sorcerers. (L V.-19. 5531-5536 1/2). Sorcerers' hearts sound like the rain when they die and their hearts fall into waterpits. Parents say they fear falling stars, because they know things that happen and always fall for a reason. Sorcerers can send their sorcery to different places to 'spirit' people away or kill them.</dc:description>

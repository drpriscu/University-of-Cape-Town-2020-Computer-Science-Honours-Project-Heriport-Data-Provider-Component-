  <dc:description>Most of the above-mentioned follies and ill-deeds of the Mantis are animadverted upon in a long rebuke, addressed to him by his grandson the Ichneumon (L II.-9.  976-996).  The Ichneumon then proceeds to comment upon some other doings of the Mantis, who - wanting to roast the little 'Loffelhund' (Proteles) - is himself roasted by its incensed mother; and, escaping, dips his singed wings into the water, and comes forth a renovated Mantis. (L II.-9. 997-1002, 10. 1003-1051) The Ichneumon rebukes |kaggen (the Mantis) for fighting every time he meets someone, and for being foolish - his wife waits hungry for him at home while he is out fighting. His bow does not shoot and his ears do not hear. He lies and argues and gets beaten because he fights badly.</dc:description>

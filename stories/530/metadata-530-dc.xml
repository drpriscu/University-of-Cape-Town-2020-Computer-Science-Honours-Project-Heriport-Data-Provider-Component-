  <dc:description>The Bushman Doctor or Sorcerer (who may be of either sex.) By /han=kasso (L VIII.-20. 7757-7762, 7768-7774). Remarks upon sorcerers, their dress, etc. (in explanation of one of Mr Stows copies of Bushman paintings), by Dia!kwain (L V.-10. 4750, 4755-4757). A curious description of a dance and other doings of sorcerers was given in explanation of No. 3 of Mr Stows copies of Bushman paintings (L V.-22. 5755-5775). Further details regarding sorcerers (suggested by Mr J.M. Orpens copy of Bushman paintings - published in the Cape Monthly Magazine for July, 1874.) were also given by Dia!kwain (L V.-25. 6008-6013). Dia!kwain says healers bleed from the nose when doing the ||ken dance. We must smell this blood so it will enter our 'gorge'. The blood of a healer feels like cool water and they are cold inside so must keep on their karosses. A healer who does not care for himself and trembles in his sleep may be found by others who may wish to kill him. The ||ken dance is not easy. 1) See also Mr G. Stow's Bushman picture no. 3 (the ||ken dance) and Picture of Mr Orpen's, 2) Date on p.5767: 31 December, 3) This story is found in Book V-22.</dc:description>

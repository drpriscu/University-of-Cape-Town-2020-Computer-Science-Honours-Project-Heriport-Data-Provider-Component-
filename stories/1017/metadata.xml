<title>|xue and his child</title>
<summary>|xue becomes a small bird (by the name of ||kouri) and is taken hold of by his child. His child&apos;s mother warns the child to leave |xue alone, but the child refuses, saying he wants to take hold of his father. The child puts |xue down on the ground and he flies up into the sky. |xue becomes a larger bird (called !kuarra, which seems to be an eagle) and his child sings out for !kuarra to &apos;divide my hands&apos;. The bird flies down and grabs the child&apos;s mother&apos;s head in its claws. She angrily curses |xue saying &apos;let a lion take |xue!&apos; because she wants him to vanish. The people take hold of |xue and beat him until he dies and vanishes.</summary><comments>1) pp.9327v &amp; 9328v: what the !kun say when they curse another person: when their heart aches on account of what someone has done they wish a lion to take him away and kill him so that he will disappear; the lion hears the curse and comes at night to carry the offending person away to eat them, 2) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-5</comments><date>between the 14 and 18 February 1880</date><storypages>9324-9330</storypages><category>Transformation</category><author>!nanni (XI)</author><author>Tamme (XII)</author><keyword><kw>|xue</kw><subkw>changes at sunrise and sunset</subkw></keyword>

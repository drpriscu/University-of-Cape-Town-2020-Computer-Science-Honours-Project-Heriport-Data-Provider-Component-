  <dc:description>|xue becomes a small bird (by the name of ||kouri) and is taken hold of by his child. His child's mother warns the child to leave |xue alone, but the child refuses, saying he wants to take hold of his father. The child puts |xue down on the ground and he flies up into the sky. |xue becomes a larger bird (called !kuarra, which seems to be an eagle) and his child sings out for !kuarra to 'divide my hands'. The bird flies down and grabs the child's mother's head in its claws. She angrily curses |xue saying 'let a lion take |xue!' because she wants him to vanish. The people take hold of |xue and beat him until he dies and vanishes.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>During purification (or |koa) the man being cleansed is prepared for drinking water. His father squirts water over him (on his chest and back) from his own mouth. The man being cleansed then drinks water given to him by his father. The man drinks water, but does not eat (the man is allowed to eat 'water food', or water plants, or tcha, if there are some there, and if the appropriate preparatory ceremonies have taken place, given by his father or another 'proper' person). The man must abstain from food for two days but does not abstain after he has been cleansed. 1) p.9923v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu), 2) See also Purification after shooting a person and Further particulars regarding the purification or cleansing (|koa) and What the man says while cleansing himself, 3) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-11.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Another story explains how the lions talk as men, by putting their tails into their mouths. The sister of the narrator is said to have been thus addressed. This is told in the Katkop dialect by !kweiten ta //ken (L VI.-2. 4026-4033). A story about !kweiten ta ||ken's elder sister, |a khumm, who is called by a lion but does not answer it, even though it speaks like a man. Her mother had told her never to call out in the veld or answer the call of any other thing because it might be a beast of prey and not a person.</dc:description>

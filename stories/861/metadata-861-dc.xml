  <dc:description>Mat sieves said to be generally made by the Bushmen, but skin sieves by the Grass Bushmen and the Koranna-Hottentots. In English, after Dia!kwain (L V.-25. VI note). Sieves supposed also to be used by the early race. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-27. 8391 and 8392). |han=kass'o describes some sieves (!yuiten) that he believes belonged to the Early Race of Bushmen. These sieves were used to sift !haken after digging it out. 1) See also a note by Dia!kwain in The woman who was killed by the baboons (p.5993opp) for a description of sieves made from matting (used by 'real Bushmen') and sieves made from skins used by Korannas and 'Grass Bushmen', 2) This story is found in Book VIII-27.</dc:description>

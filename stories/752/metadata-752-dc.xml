  <dc:description>Children push a youth into the skin of a Fieldmouse and tell him to 'trot away', which he does, becoming a Lion. The children tell the Lion to go and lie down, which he does. The Lion charges the people and runs at his brother's wife, biting her in the head and dragging her into the reeds.</dc:description>

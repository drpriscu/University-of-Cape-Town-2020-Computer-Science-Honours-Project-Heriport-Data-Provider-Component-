  <dc:description>Children push a youth into the skin of a Fieldmouse and tell him to 'trot away', which he does, becoming a Lion. The children tell the Lion to go and lie down, which he does. The Lion charges the people and runs at his brother's wife, biting her in the head and dragging her into the reeds. 1) p.7526v: |han=kass'o was told this story by his mother (|xabbi-an), who he thinks heard it from her mother (=kammi); on the Fieldmouse's name (it is 'mouse' and it has no other), 2) pp.7528v-7529v: an explanation of !kuppem !kuppem (and calling to the fieldmice), 3) p.7537v: the Tarru-ggu or akkedis (the sister-in-law is one), 4) This story is found in Book VIII-17.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A description of an edible plant called the |khoro. It grows on the ground and the root is cooked in the fire. The birds eat the fruit. Certain practices relating to phases of the moon are observed when eating this or the =gue-||na plant. There is a description of the two plants and where and how they grow. Their stems climb trees and are long, but the edible parts of the plants are short. Both of these plants can be harmful if eaten at the wrong time. 1) p.9887v: !nanni heard this from his paternal grandfather (Karu) and observed it himself; see also !nanni's drawing of the =gue-||na dated 1 August 1881 (NLLB_D_!n083), 2) a !kun custom in which a person desists from eating if he has shot another person (or a countryman) who takes a long time to die, 3) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-11.</dc:description>

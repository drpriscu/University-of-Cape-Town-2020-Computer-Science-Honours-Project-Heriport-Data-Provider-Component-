  <dc:description>The name of the Lion not to be spoken by children. In the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain, from =kamme-an (L V.-7. 4526 and 4526, 8. 4527-4562). Another version of this warning (L V.-8. 4563-4573). Children must never disrespect the lion or 'play with its name', or it will remember and teach them a lesson when they are adults on the hunting-ground. 1) p.4564v: grown-ups may say the lion's name, 2) p.4567v: the lion shows children (when they are grown-up) what it is like to be a plaything (as when they played with its name) by being his 'plaything' on the hunting-ground, 3) p.4572v: Xwerri-kau played with the lion's name as a child, 4) See also What the lion did to Xwerri-kau and The avoidance of the name of the lion, 5) This story is found in Book V-8.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Mantis, the valiant Striped Mouse [Mus Pumilio, Common Striped Field-Mouse of the Cape], the other Mice, and the Beetle . By /han=kasso (L VIII.-17. 7542-7549, 18. 7550). This is a story of the Early Race when the Mice are people who are not strong and the Beetle kills them. |kaggen (the Mantis) dreams about the Beetle and tells the Striped Mouse (who is strong) to go to the river bed where the Beetle waits.

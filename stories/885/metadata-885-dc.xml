  <dc:description>A young man of the Early Race marries =nerru (also a person of the Early Race). They are out collecting 'Bushman rice' and fill their bag, so the husband asks  |nerru to use her kaross. She does not want to and he snatches it away from her.  =nerru's bowels come pouring down. She replaces her bowels and returns to her mother's house. Her husband comes along looking for his wife, but =nerru's mother is angry with him for his lack of understanding. 1) See also Description of the =nerru, 2) p.8506v: |han=kass'o heard this from his mother (|xabbi-an), 3) p.8510v: the |xam term for a kaross made of only one animal skin, 4) p.8511v: the words are spoken by =nerru in this instance, but many of the stories of the Early Race involve singing, 5) p.8523v: the people who spoke to |han=kass'o's mother (and made her 'understand'), 6) This story is found in Book VIII-28.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>A story of the Xara (or Erdmann) and his fight with Ichneumon, who wants to take the Xara's eland, so picks a fight but loses and runs away. A fable, in the Katkop dialect (told to =kasin by his mother, relates how the Ichneumon came to some mierkats, or suricats (here called Xarra), who were cutting up an eland which one of them had shot, and how he disputed the prey with them, but unsuccessfully. This is evidently a fable belonging to the series of myths of the Mantis (L IV.-2. 3520-3533). 1) This story was told to =kasin by his mother, 2) p.3519v: the Dutch name for this creature (which is a meerkat) is Erdmann (it is described as having red hair and stripes with a whitish tip on its tail), in a note written by Bleek, 3) p.3530v: the |xam name of Hetrodes (a type of field cricket) and |xam and Koranna names for a similar sort of cricket; the |xam name for a certain yellow and black spider, 4) This story is found in Book IV-2.</dc:description>

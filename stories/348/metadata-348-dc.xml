  <dc:description>Erdmann A fable, in the Katkop dialect (told to =kasin by his mother, relates how the Ichneumon came to some mierkats, or suricats (here called Xarra), who were cutting up an eland which one of them had shot, and how he disputed the prey with them, but unsuccessfully. This is evidently a fable belonging to the series of myths of the Mantis (L IV.-2. 3520-3533).</dc:description>

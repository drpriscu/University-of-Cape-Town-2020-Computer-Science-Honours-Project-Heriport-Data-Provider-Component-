  <dc:description>Explanation of various personal names was given, in the Katkop dialect, by Dia!kwain (L V.-10. 4751-4754, 4758-4777, 18. 5373 rev., 19. 5505 rev. and 5506 rev., 20. 5572 and 5573, 5605-5607). Dia!kwain's mother named his brother Ko-bbo because the people at their place blamed her family for all the misfortunes that occurred there. They called Dia!kwain's people 'Bbo' and threatened them. These same people killed Dia!kwain's grandmother and grandfather 'with sorcery' and intended to kill the rest of his family as well.</dc:description>

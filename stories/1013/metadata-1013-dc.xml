  <dc:description>An account of how two !kun (called |xue and ||namme) go into the house of a |nani. They sit down at the |nani's fire to warm themselves because it has been raining. A |nani child sees them and wakes his father and tells him that two !kun are warming themselves at the fire. The !kun men run away and the |nani father chases them and aims at them with his bow and arrow. The |nani throws an axe at the retreating men but misses them and |xue shoots and kills him instead.</dc:description>

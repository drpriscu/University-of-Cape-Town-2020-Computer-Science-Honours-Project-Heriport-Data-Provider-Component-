  <dc:date>2020-09-12</dc:date>
  <dc:description>An account of how two !kun (called |xue and ||namme) go into the house of a |nani. They sit down at the |nani's fire to warm themselves because it has been raining. A |nani child sees them and wakes his father and tells him that two !kun are warming themselves at the fire. The !kun men run away and the |nani father chases them and aims at them with his bow and arrow. The |nani throws an axe at the retreating men but misses them and |xue shoots and kills him instead. 1) p.9311: Tamme heard this from his father (||namme) who heard it from his father (Nakua), 2) Although the title says '|xe', presumably it refers to '|xue' who does appear later in the story to shoot the |nani, 3) p.9312v: the Ovaherero do not come into contact with the |nani because the |nani's country is too far off; the |nani do come into contact with the Makoba and go on or in their boats (it isn't clear for what purpose), 4) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-4.</dc:description>

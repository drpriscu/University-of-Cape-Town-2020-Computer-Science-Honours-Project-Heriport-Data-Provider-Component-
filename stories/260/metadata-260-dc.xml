  <dc:description>Lions (who are different) steal to the people's houses at night and carry them away while they sleep. The people burn the lions out of the reeds and chase them away. The sons say that they will burn the reeds so that new ones will grow and the lions will never return and will go elsewhere. More than one hundred columns (1548-1652) of his discourse treat only of lions and Bushmen, and it runs at last into a description of the doings of the jackals, which, however, has been brought under a separate heading (L II.-15. 1432-1499, 16. 1500-1553, 17. 1554-1622, 18. 1623-1691, 19. 1692-1710) . 1) p.1602v: the metal arrow point is fixed onto a thing like a harpoon before being attached to the reed shaft, 2) p.1627v: a large thorn tree of the Groot River (appears to be the Orange River), 3) See also The Day's Heart star, 4) This story is found in Books II-16, II-17 and II-18.</dc:description>

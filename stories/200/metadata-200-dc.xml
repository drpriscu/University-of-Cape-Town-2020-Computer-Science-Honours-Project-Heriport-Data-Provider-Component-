The Anteater told the people to cook meat on a fire and use pots and other utensils, whereas other animals eat raw flesh. They eat ants' eggs and ostrich egg yolks and plants such as gambro, but they must not eat wild dogs. They use feathers from specific birds for their arrows. 1) Date on p.454: 26 August; p.459: 4 September; p.463: 7 November, 2) This story is found in Book II-3.</dc:description>

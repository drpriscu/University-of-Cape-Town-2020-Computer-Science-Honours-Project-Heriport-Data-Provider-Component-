  <dc:description>The Mantis visits the abode of the Ticks, attempts to take some of their food, and is well beaten by them. He flies away, goes into the water, and returns home where he is pitied and lectured by the Ichneumon. (L VIII.-3. 6236-6258, 6267-6269). In a further account of the Mantis and the Ticks, the Mantis pays a visit to the houses of the Ticks, is worsted by them, and escapes. Having been counselled by /kwámmana, through the young Ichneumon, he goes again to the Ticks, gets the better of them, and brings their sheep home (L VIII.-20. 7790-7811). |kaggen (the Mantis) visits the Ticks, who see him coming and hide in sheep's wool. |kaggen tastes some food from one of their pots and the Ticks beat him. He flies away and returns to his house, where |kwammana tells him how to defeat the Ticks. 1) Note on p.7790 'Oct 1919' (when D. Bleek translated), 2) This story was told to |han≠kass'o by his mother (|xabbi-an), 2) p.7810v: a method of 'dipping' meat using a wooden spoon (Dutch and |xam words for 'dishing up'), 3) See also The Mantis takes away the Tick's sheep (including Porcupine's speech concerning the coming of ||khwai-hemm) and The Mantis and ||khwai-hemm, 4) This story is found in Book VIII-20.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Tamme contributes words and sentences relating to everyday life in his country. The list includes !kun terms for weapons (especially arrows and arrow-making), parts of the body, plants and animals, cooking utensils, colours, numbers, weather, relations and words gained from contact with Europeans (such as tinderboxes and whipping). The names of !nanni's four brothers and sisters are noted and there are other references to the boys' personal experiences, including a fragment of a song !nanni sings when weeding, an occasional mention of the boys' parents, how |han=kass'o 'takes' Tamme to 'sleep', how Tamme's father is dead and so on. |han=kass'o has provided |xam equivalents for some of the !kun vocabulary and some of the notes on the verso pages are made by !nanni.</dc:description>

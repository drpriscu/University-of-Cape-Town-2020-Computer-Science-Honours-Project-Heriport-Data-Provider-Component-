  <dc:description>!nanni's paternal grandfather (Karu) told him to be quiet and told him the story of the Hyena (or ||gaxa) who entered the Lion's house. The Lion had forbidden the Hyena to talk like the Lion did (the Lions talked). The Lion puts food to cook on the fire (which seems to be caterpillars). The Lion wakes the Hyena and tells it to say 'Mmmm' and eat the little caterpillars, but the Hyena says '=naa!' instead. It does not want to eat the hairy caterpillars. The Lion listens to the sounds that the Hyena makes and objects to its speech. The Lion pierces the Hyena's hindleg and it says '=naa!' several times and then '=e sho-sho!' as well and runs away. 1) Stories such as this one are reminiscent of the 'First Bushmen' stories of the |xam, 2) p.9290v: !nanni heard this story from his paternal grandfather (Karu, also referred to as Yaru or Yara), 2) p.9293v: the hyena has two names (||hou and ||gaxa), 3) p.9296v: !nanni's father's father told him many things: 'Many days my father told me many things', 4) This story is found in Book XI &amp; XII-4.</dc:description>

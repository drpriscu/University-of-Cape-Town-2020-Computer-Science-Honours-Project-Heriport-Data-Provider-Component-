She lived at the Sak River with Dia!kwain's people, where he observed her actions firsthand. 1) |xannay |xannay is also spelt |xannan |xannan (in the |xam text transcribed in the notebook); it is not clear if |xannay |xannay can be called a sorcerer, but she did command and 'possess' wind, 2) p.5860v: (11 January 1876) Dia!kwain married |xannay |xannay's son's daughter; the back of his father-in-law's head resembled an ostrich, as did hers; the term 'hare's house' used to describe the back of a person's head, 3) p.5870v: a bird (|kain-|kain) found in Bushmanland, 4) See also |xannay |xannay and the wind, 5) This story is found in Book V-23.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>An exhortation, to the Bushmen, to be careful of food in time of plenty, is followed by a description of the jackals doings with regard to food, etc. (L VIII.-16. 7449-7451, 7448 rev.-7450 rev., and 7452-7456). When food is plentiful (in times of abundant rainfall) the people say that they must put the food away properly so they will not be like the jackal, which is always going along looking for where it has put its food (its 'plenty').</dc:description>

  <dc:description>Words and sentences provided by Da in May 1880 (and added to in October 1881). The other boys have also added various explanations, corrections and notes which Lloyd has noted on the verso pages and throughout some of the text. Da has provided the names of parts of the body, details of practices and objects he encountered in his daily life, and the odd detail relating to his experiences (and capture) and his parents and relations (before he was taken away from them). Da also gives the names for parts and markings of arrows and their uses, as well as the names of other implements and weapons used by his people. Da also mentions some of the other peoples found in his country (such as the Makoba and the Damara) and some of his people's experiences with them.</dc:description>

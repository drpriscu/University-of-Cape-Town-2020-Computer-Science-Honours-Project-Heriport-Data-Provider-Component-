  <dc:description>The !kwai-!kwai, the Mantis, and the Children. The !kwai-!kwai, who was formerly a man, and is now a bird (in appearance somewhat resembling a 'duiker'), comes, during the absence of their parents, to kill the children. They are defended by the Mantis, who causes the death of !kwai-!kwai. By /han=kasso (L VIII.-3.  6304-6322, 4. 6323-6333). A note to the above story was also given by /han=kasso (L VIII.-18. 7596, 7597 and 7595 rev.). |kaggen (the Mantis) puts the !kwai !kwai on the fire to roast (and in so doing kills it) because he wants to resurrect the children the !kwai !kwai has killed. The children return to life. 1) See also The !kwai !kwai, the Mantis and the children, 2) p.7595v: see Sneezing; |han=kass'o heard this from his mother (|xabbi-an), 3) This story is found in Book VIII-18.</dc:description>

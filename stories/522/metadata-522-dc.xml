  <dc:description>Regarding various Bushmen. Partly in English after and partly in Bushman (L V.-21. 5702 rev. and 5703 rev.). A note about the child Kki-a-||ken (who had been made very ill after throwing stones at a swallow). He lived and was killed in adulthood by 'half-white' (and half kku'obbo) people. Some biographical details of his relations (he was one of Dia!kwain's cousins) and a description of how he died along with three other |xam. They were driven to a cliff by men on horseback and killed there. This account includes the names of the other man who died with Kki-a-||ken, or Stuurman (Gert Rounabout, ||kum-!kan or Prince Santkop, and Swaart Klaas). 1) See also Swallows, 2) This story is found in Book V-21.</dc:description>

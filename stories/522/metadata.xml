Partly in English after and partly in Bushman (L V.-21. 5702 rev. and 5703 rev.).</i> A note about the child Kki-a-||ken (who had been made very ill after throwing stones at a swallow). He lived and was killed in adulthood by &apos;half-white&apos; (and half <i>kku&apos;obbo</i>) people. Some biographical details of his relations (he was one of Dia!kwain&apos;s cousins) and a description of how he died along with three other |xam. They were driven to a cliff by men on horseback and killed there. This account includes the names of the other man who died with Kki-a-||ken, or Stuurman (Gert Rounabout, ||kum-!kan or Prince Santkop, and Swaart Klaas).  </summary><comments>1) See also <i>Swallows</i>, 2) This story is found in Book V-21</comments><date>December 1875</date><storypages>5702v-5703v</storypages><category>History (personal)</category><category>Relations with others</category><author>Dia!kwain (David Hoesar) (V)</author><keyword><kw>personal history</kw><subkw>of Kki-a-||ken who threw stones at swallows</subkw></keyword>

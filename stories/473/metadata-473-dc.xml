  <dc:description>A series of six inserts on the inside cover of Book V-17 which contain brief references to falling stars, earthquakes and sorcerers, as well as some |xam names for certain animals. Reference is also made to the 'speech' of ants and there are a few lines about a 'tiger'. Most significantly, there is a note on drawings made by Dia!kwain's father on rocks and ostrich skins and the preparation of painting substances, such as rooi klip (or red haematite). 1) See also Chippings made by Dia!kwain's father (before the time of the 'Boers'), 2) This story is found in Book V-17.</dc:description>

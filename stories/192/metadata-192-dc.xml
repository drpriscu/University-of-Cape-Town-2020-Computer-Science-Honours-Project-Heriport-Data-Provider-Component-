  <dc:description>This account [of The Anteater, Springbok and Lynx] is again followed by the Anteaters laws concerning the habits of various animals, such as the jackal, the 'Loffelhund' (Proteles), etc., who were, once upon a time, men.  (L II.-2. 323-356.) The Strandwolf marries a Strandwolf and has Strandwolf children and they live in a 'hollow'. The Aardwolf marries a She-Aardwolf and they have children. They live in the earth as they did when they were people. 1) See also The Anteater, Springbok and Lynx (||kabbo's version 1) and The Anteater, Springbok and Lynx  (//kabbo's version 2), 2) This story is found in Book II-2.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>According to Tamme's people, |xue is Hu'-we and also the Hare (who creates things). The Hare puts the person he has made into an antelope-skin bag (there are four bags and four kinds of people, each speaking different languages). He takes one bag of people and throws it far away. He throws a bag of thread or string far away so that the people may catch and eat antelope. At sunrise |xue comes to him and says that the Hare is a mere hare and must behave like a mere hare. The Hare says he is also |xue and speaks !kun (he says this somewhat peevishly, as he seems to feel that he has been doing so all along). |xue tells the Hare to put food into a bag for the people, but the Hare refuses to feed them, saying |xue must do so with his own food. |xue throws bags with food and with a bow and arrows to the !kun's country and tells them to shoot the Hare.</dc:description>

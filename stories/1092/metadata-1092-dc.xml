  <dc:description>According to Tamme's people, |xue is Hu'-we and also the Hare (who creates things). The Hare puts the person he has made into an antelope-skin bag (there are four bags and four kinds of people, each speaking different languages). He takes one bag of people and throws it far away. He throws a bag of thread or string far away so that the people may catch and eat antelope. At sunrise |xue comes to him and says that the Hare is a mere hare and must behave like a mere hare. The Hare says he is also |xue and speaks !kun (he says this somewhat peevishly, as he seems to feel that he has been doing so all along). |xue tells the Hare to put food into a bag for the people, but the Hare refuses to feed them, saying |xue must do so with his own food. |xue throws bags with food and with a bow and arrows to the !kun's country and tells them to shoot the Hare. 1) p.9893v: Tamme heard this from his father (||namme-sso'-yo); the names of some of Tamme's relations (who passed down the story), 2) p.9938opp: (October 1881) a note added by !nanni concerning going into 'another country', 3) p.9942v: (22 March 1882) words and sentences concerning killing the Damara and strong, grown-up !kun, 4) p.9898v: (30 September 1881) Tamme names different groups of !kun: this includes the names of the groups of !kun that Tamme, |uma and !nanni belong to (||koo yau, =ka'o yau, and ||noo yau), 5) See also The Moon and the Hare and |xue (Tamme) and also the |xam story The Moon and the little Hare (in Book II-6) for other examples of narratives in which the Hare who fears death appears, 6) This story is found in Books XI, XII-11 &amp; XII-12.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>An account, apparently a legend, called in my first report 'Stones which kill the thrower', given by /a!k nta in very early days (L I. 2. 125 and 126), wants revision and further explanation to render it intelligible. A man makes a hole in the ground and sits next to it. He calls to another man who throws a stone at his forehead, but the stone flies back at the man who threw it, killing him, and he falls into the hole.</dc:description>

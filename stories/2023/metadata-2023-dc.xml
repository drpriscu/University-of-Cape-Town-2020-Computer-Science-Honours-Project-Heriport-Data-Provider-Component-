Bleek."; 2) Written inside the front cover: "From 2 September /79 To 11 November /79"; 3) There is an insert featuring lists of clicks and vocabulary in the front of the notebook; 4) p.2 features the comment in English 'lamb in picture book' which indicates Jemima Bleek was probably showing the boys picture books as a means of getting vocabulary.

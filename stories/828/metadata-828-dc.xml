  <dc:description>The Lion is believed to possess the power of assuming other forms. (L VIII.-23. 8075-8077). It assumes the form of a hartebeest because it wants the people to try and head it as if it were game. It also assumes the form of a person (and wears a kaross). 1) p.8074v: |han=kass'o heard this from Tsatsi as well as from a man called !kui (or Ttarro-hho, or Bartman Bastard); this latter man's youthful name was Ttarro-hho and his grown-up name was !kui !ka xu, which he was given because he was a 'bad man' and a woman threw fire at him, burning him, when he 'wished to marry her'; a lion who 'does not understand' comes to people's huts to kill them, 2) pp.8075v &amp; 8076v: (28 December 1878) see Children do not say the lion's name at night, 3) See also A wild cat, when many have been killed by a person changes itself into a lion and kills the slayer, 4) This story is found in Book VIII-23.</dc:description>

  <dc:description>The Bushman Doctor or Sorcerer (L II.-1. 273-275).  An account of these people was also given in the Katkop dialect by Dia!kwain (L V.-3. 4122-4131), from whom we besides have two reports of cures performed upon himself. The first of these (L V.-3. 4132-4161, 4. 4162-4199) includes a speech made by the sorceress; the second relates how she cured him when injured by a Kafir (L V.-4. 4200-4230). The healer (or !gixa) !kwarra-an heals ('snores') Dia!kwain. Afterwards she tells his mother all about her work and complains about her treatment by the people. The healer does not wish to do good work because she is angry that the people do not pay her. There are additional notes about 'sneezing' (|kamma) and what comes out afterwards.</dc:description>

One of these accounts (L II.-1. 266-272), the beginning of which is also given in another version (B II. 350), carries him only a part of the way; while the other narrates the whole journey down, as far as the Breakwater (L II.-1. 242-250). ||kabbo's account of his capture and jailing. He is with his wife, his son, his son's wife, his daughter, his son's child, his daughter's child and her husband. Black men take them and put them into a wagon.  The women are let out of the wagon and made to walk. Later the wagon stops and they are all let off to walk. They make a fire and roast lamb and springbok which they eat. They then smoke and  later go to sleep. At daybreak they smoke again at the fire and are then taken to see the magistrate. They are made to leave their wives who are walking. The black men take them away at night after they have spoken with the magistrate, and put their legs into stocks at the jail. After some time some Korannas also arrive at the jailhouse. They are then moved into another jailhouse. 1) Note on the inside of the back cover of this notebook: 'Finished correcting Sept 15/71 from Jantje Toorm himself', 2) p.271v: the name of another man placed into stocks (Piet Rooi), 3) See also //kabbo's account of being caught and brought to the Breakwater and Jantje's capture, 4) This story is found in Book II-1.</dc:description>

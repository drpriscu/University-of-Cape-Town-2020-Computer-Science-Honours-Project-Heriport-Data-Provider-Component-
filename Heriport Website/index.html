								<h3>HERIPORT Project Context and Aims</h3> <p> Digital heritage portals have recently been introduced with the
									purpose of preserving and accessing historical information. Heritage portals that encompass archives from various external
									sources have been implemented internationally for projects such as the Europeana project, but this has not yet been developed for South
									African heritage archives. This project therefore aimed to create the first central low-cost local heritage portal encompassing multiple local archives, using metadata harvesting via the Open Archive Interface Protocol Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). The system was divided up into three respective components as seen in Figure 1 below: The Data Provider Interfaces, The Harvester and the Web Portal. These components are discussed in their relative tabs.

								<h3>HERIPORT Project Conclusions</h3> <p> Overall, the HERIPORT system was successfully implemented with three separable and reusable components. The successful implementation of the HERIPORT project sees this as the first national heritage metadata aggregator. As it has been built upon the philosophies of current low-resource software tools, this project could add meaningful contribution to the research community. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Data Provider Interfaces</h2>
								<h3>Project Goals</h3> <p> This project focused on the design and implementation of the Data Provider
									Interfaces component of the prototype as a software engineering project. The aim of the Data Provider Interfaces component was to map the original metadata from the Data Providers to unqualified Dublin Core and expose the metadata using the OAI-PMH. </p>
								<h3>Project Scope </h3><p>Three unqualified Dublin Core (DC) Converter applications were implemented to map the original metadata to DC and three OAI-PMH Data Provider Interfaces were developed to expose the DC metadata to be aggregated by the Harvester component. The architecture showing the components and interactions of the Data Provider Intefaces is shown in Figure 1 below. Each interface provides OAI-PMH request and response services to view the metadata of a repository (shown in Figure 2). These include GetRecords, GetIdentifiers, ListRecords, ListIdentifiers, ListSets, ListMetadataFormats and Identify.

								<h3>Project Results</h3> <p> Functional and non-functional requirements of the Data Provider Interfaces were evaluated by Unit, Correctness, Compliance, Conformance, Integration and User Evaluation testing.</p>
								<h4> Unit Testing Results</h4> <p>From Unit testing, it was found that some DC fields of the metadata records contained no values in the OAI-PMH responses and specific
									metadata records could not be displayed in an OAI-PMH response as they contained non-ASCII characters. Unit testing was then performed in
									Iteration 2 on the DC Converters to evaluate whether they successfully normalised non-ASCII characters after further development. Table 1
									shows that all Unit test cases of the DC Converters and OAI-PMH Interfaces passed.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/DPIResults1.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Table 1: Unit Testing Results</figcaption></span>
								<h4> Conformance Testing Results </h4> <p>Results from the Conformance testing of DC Converters in Table 2 show that The New Digital Bleek and Lloyd Archive DC Converter achieved 2057 successful conversions out of 2057 records equating to a 100%
									success rate, The Five Hundred Year Archive DC Converter achieved 87 successful conversions out of 87 records equating to a 100% and The
									Metsemegologolo Archive DC Converter achieved one successful conversion out of one record, equating to a 100% success rate. These
									results indicate that all records were successfully converted to the DC standard and each DC Converter performed correctly. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/DPIResults2.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Table 2: Conformance Testing Results</figcaption></span>
								<h4>Compliance Testing Results </h4> <p>All test cases passed, indicating that all OAI-PMH requests returned expected responses for each of the six verbs, and that the Data Provider Interfaces for each Data Provider produced valid OAI-PMH standard responses. The full results is shown here: <a href = "images/DPRComp.png" target = "_blank"><i>Final Compliance Testing Results.</i></a></p>
								<h4>Integration Testing Results </h4> <p> Results from the Integration testing of Data Provider Interfaces with the
									Harvester in Table 3 show that the Harvester could successfully request and receive expected responses for each of the six OAI-PMH verbs. These results of no failure cases indicate the Data Provider Interfaces can be harvested from, in a metadata aggregator system.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/DPIResults3.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Table 3: Integration Testing Results</figcaption></span>
								<h4> User Evaluation Results</h4> <p> Results from the User Evaluation test with 5 Data Provider and 5 student participants are shown in Table 4, where “Y” stands for “Yes” and “N” for “No”. The table shows that 100 percent of participants were able to see the metadata for a specific field, that the expected fields were displayed for metadata records, and that the metadata records displayed fields about the correct item. 90 Percent of participants said the identifier field linked to the original metadata item. The one participant who answered “No” was the only representative from The Metsemegologolo Archive, as this Data Provider does not have an active website hosting the item. These results indicate that Data Provider Interfaces fulfilled the functional requirements gathered.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/DPIResults4.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Table 4: User Evaluation Testing Results</figcaption></span>
								<h3>Project Conclusions</h3> <p> Based on the assessment of the test results, it was concluded that Data Provider Interfaces could successfully convert the metadata to DC and expose the metadata using the OAI-PMH. It was also concluded that this software component prototype was a successful proof of concept in building the Data Provider Interfaces layer of a three-layer metadata aggregator system architecture. Overall, the Data Provider Interfaces can be integrated and reused in future projects and fill the gap in building a low-cost South African National Heritage Web Portal with metadata aggregation.

									<h2 class="major">Harvester</h2>
									<h3>Project Goals</h3>
									<p>The project aimed to develop a standalone harvester component of the centralized cultural heritage portal that entails features that can be considered low-cost while using best practices. This was done by extensively using metadata aggregation and OAI-PMH. In terms of  low-cost, the aim was to create a component that conformed to the following features: one that was simple, scalable, and easy to install and maintain. Therefore, the Harvester was made to be applicable to many systems and repositories. The primary objective of the project was to demonstrate the viability of the component as a proof of concept while using a software engineering approach.</p>
									<h3>Project Results</h3>
									<p>The  Harvester  component  consists  of  the OAI harvester  and repository. From the HERIPORT Architecture Diagram, the Repository Interface refers to the interface provided by Apache Solr and the Repository refers to XML flat files. The OAI harvester harvests records into the repository from the provided data provider interfaces. With the use of an interface, the frontend Web Portal can access the repository and provide value-added services to different users. Figure 1, below illustrates the functionality and processes that the Harvester component performs. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/HFigure2.png" alt="" /><figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Figure 1: High-Level Overall Process </figcaption></span>
									<p>To evaluate the component, Unit, Integration, Performance and Scalibility Testing was conducted. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/HFigure3.png" alt="" /><figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Figure 2: M1 vs M2</figcaption></span>
									<p>The performance of two machines, namely M1 and M2, was compared on each repository tested. Figure 2 above, illustrates the performance comparison on one of these repositories. As expected M1 out performed M2 due to its better processor and faster internet.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/HFigure4.png" alt="" /><figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Figure 3: Repositories Comparison (End to End)</figcaption></span>
									<span class="image main" ><img src="images/HFigure5.png" alt="" /><figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Figure 4: Repositories Comparison (Local)</figcaption></span>
									<p>Figures 3 and 4 illustrates the performance comparison between local and non-local processes on each repositories. The performance inconsistencies shown in Figure 3 are explained by external processing when requesting for records on a OAI-conformant repository. Figure 4, ignores times taken for the external processing, therefore showing a more accurate server side perfornance comparison. The diagrams above also illlustrate a linear increase in time as the number of records are increases therefore ensuring scalability.</p>
									<h3>Project Conclusions</h3>
									<p>Key findings during the testing included the ability to cater to performance and scalability aspects. Another interesting finding was that the OAI harvesting times also depended on any pre-processing done by OAI-conformant repositories which were confirmed by Figures 3 and 4. The development of the Harvester component was concluded as a success in terms of integration, performance, and scalability. Furthermore, in terms of the whole system, all components integrated successfully providing us with a sensibly working Cultural Heritage Web Portal.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Web Portal</h2>
								<h3>Project Goals</h3> <p>This project aimed to develop the Web Portal component that provides an interface for end-users to access multiple South African heritage archives. It further aimed to provide cross-archive discovery services - search and browse. The Web Portal functional requirements are shown in Figure 1 below.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/WP1.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Figure 1: Web Portal Functional Requirements UML Use Case Diagram</figcaption></span>
								<h3>Project Results</h3> <p> </p>
								<h4>User Acceptance Testing Results</h4><p>As seen in Table 1 below, the large majority of participants were able to
									successfully complete all the tasks related to the functional requirements of the Web portal. The only participant from the Metsemegologolo archive was unable to be redirected to the original
									resource through the identifier as Metsemegologolo does not currently have a website hosting their data.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/WPR1.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Table 1: User Acceptance Testing Results</figcaption></span>
								<h4>Usability Testing Results</h4><p> Table 2 displays the Usability Test results of the 4 testing categories
									for the 2 groups, as well as the overall results. All results were rated with a score out of 5, with a score of 5 denoting “Strongly Agree” and a score of 1 denoting “Strongly Disagree”. Figure 2 provides a graphic representation of these results whereby the average is also grasped visually.</p>

								<h4>Integration Testing Results</h4> <p>Table 3 displays all relevant Dublin Core fields harvested and their
									result of being able to display correctly on the Web portal per iteration. The results indicate that the display of the fields dc_creator,
									dc_publisher and dc_contributer was not always functioning correctly. This was due to issues related to these fields containing
									multiple values. This issue was resolved by editing the Apache Solr schema configuration file appropriately to accommodate these fields’ format.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/WPR4.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Table 3: Integration Testing Results</figcaption></span>
								<h4>Correctness Testing Results</h4> <p>Table 4 presents the Correctness Testing results for different test
									cases in the iterations 1, 2 and 3. ‘P’ or ‘F’ denote “Pass” or “Fail” in terms of displaying correctly on the Web browser. In Iteration 1,
									search items’ JSON responses from the testing data was tested. All test cases passed. In Iteration 2, search items’ text responses for the
									data providers’ data were tested. The fields only containing single values passed but the fields containing multiple values such as
									‘creator’ or ‘contributor’ failed to display correctly. This was resolved during iteration 3, whereby search items’ text responses for multi-valued fields and browse items were tested. All test cases passed in the final iteration. </p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/WPR5.png" alt="" /> <figcaption style =  "text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Table 4: Correctness Testing Results</figcaption></span>
								<h3>Project Conclusions</h3> <p>The aims of this project were fulfilled, whereby a heritage Web portal, built upon metadata aggregation, was successfully developed.
									Particularly, the resulting Web portal met its functional requirementsof providing search and browse services and displaying metadata
									information to users through a user interface.  The success of the functional requirements was tested and deduced
									through User Acceptance, Integration and Correctness Testing whereby the results indicated that these requirements were achieved.<br><br> The Web Portal Home page is presented in Figure 3 below, followed by an external link to the Web Portal website. </p>
